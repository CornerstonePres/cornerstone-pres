Join us this Sunday (June 28) as we worship via ZOOM and YouTube Livestream. 

As the Governor has approved Thurston County for Phase 3, our next outdoor worship is scheduled for July 19, 2020 in a COVID-19 safe environment. Our *COVID procedures* are posted on site. As wearing a mask in public is mandaotry, we will provide a mask for those who do not have one. Hand-sanitizer is available on-site and we encourage you to bring your own as well as bringing your own tissues. One entrance, one restroom will be available for sanitation purposes.
