May 9th, at 10 AM**,** the Cornerstone church family will offer "hybrid" worship in the SANCTUARY and via ZOOM.  

Scripture Readings: Luke 2:41-51

Message Title: Nurture       We are pleased to welcome 2 guest speakers to the pulpit this Mother's Day.  Hayden Warrior is a senior at Capital High School in Olympia and Marne Henderson is the Greater Olympia Associate Area Director for Young Life.  They will share with us about being a Nurturing Community. It takes a village to raise up a generation of adults we look up to.

As a Matthew 25 church, Cornerstone Cares about God's people in each walk of life and seeks to support ministries that help us eradicate systemic poverty and dismantle structural racism.
