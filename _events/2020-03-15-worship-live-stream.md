**COVID-safe Environment**: the leadership at Cornerstone has adopted the following COVID-19 plan for our outdoor worship services. **We will not be worshiping or offering groups indoors at this time.** All outdoor worship participants *must* (1) wear a mask and (2) maintain a *minimum* safe distance of at least 6 feet from others \[preferably 8 to 10 feet]. **We provide** hand sanitizer, masks for those in need, sanitizing of restrooms after each use when we worship outdoors or inside the sanctuary.     LOVE GOD, LOVE OTHERS, and SERVE THE WORLD.
