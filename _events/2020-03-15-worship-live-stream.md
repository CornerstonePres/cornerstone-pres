As the Governor has approved Thurston County for Phase 3, our next outdoor worship is scheduled for July 19, 2020 in a COVID-19 safe environment. Our *COVID procedures* are posted on campus. As wearing a mask in public is mandatory, we will provide a mask for those who do not have one. Hand-sanitizer and tissue packs  available on-site for your convenience The only portion of the house that will be available is the restroom off the garage.
