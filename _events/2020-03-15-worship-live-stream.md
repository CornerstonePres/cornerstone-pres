**COVID-safe Environment**: the leadership at Cornerstone has adopted the following COVID-19 plan for our outdoor worship services. **We will not be worshiping or offering groups indoors at this time.** All outdoor worship participants *must* (1) wear a mask \[we will provide one for those who forget to bring one with them]; and (2) maintain a *minimum* safe distance of at least 6 feet from others \[preferably 8 to 10 feet]. We provide hand sanitizer, masks for those in need, santizing of restrooms after each use, and worship in an outdoor setting with no more than two music leaders. All attendees will remain masked and distanced as we LOVE GOD, LOVE OTHERS, and SERVE THE WORLD.
