February 14, at 10 AM, the Cornerstone church family will worship via **ZOOM** this Sunday.  We are welcoming Rev. Riley Pickett to the pulpit. Rev. Pickett is the Re-entry Pastor with Hagars Community Church. Hagars Community Church is a PC(USA) 1001 Worshiping Communities ministry located at Purdy Washington Corrections Center for Women (WCCW). Her ministry supports women who are reuniting with their community, provides space for a person to be part of a Christian community to support them through this transition and becoming their Christian family. Here is a link to learn more about how you can become involved with [Hagars Community Church](https://www.hagarscommunitychurch.com). As a Matthew 25 church, Cornerstone Cares about God's people in each walk of life and seeks to support ministries that help us eradicate systemic poverty and dismantle structural racism.

**Scripture**: John 4:5-30; 39-42

**Sermon Title**: *Not to Fix, But to Encounter*

LOVE GOD, LOVE OTHERS, and SERVE THE WORLD.
