Join us this Sunday (July 12) as we worship via ZOOM and video.

We have a different type of worship service planned.

The service will start off with ZOOM as usual, at 10 AM. When it comes time, Rev. Dr. Elizabeth Klein will give the sermon via the YouTube link below. When her sermon ends we will rejoin our ZOOM service.
