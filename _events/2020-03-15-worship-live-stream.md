March 7th, at 10 AM, the Cornerstone church family will worship via **ZOOM** this Sunday.  As a Matthew 25 church, Cornerstone Cares about God's people in each walk of life and seeks to support ministries that help us eradicate systemic poverty and dismantle structural racism.

**As we approach the events of Holy Week, Good Friday and Easter,** we might still ponder the deep questions about "Why did Jesus have to die on the cross?" Karyn DeFant admits that the depth of what that means is a mystery she has considered for decades. Through the words of music, traditional and contemporary, scripture, and some thoughts and experiences from her life, she will share with us during the worship service. 

The title of the message**: "I wonder as I wander"**
