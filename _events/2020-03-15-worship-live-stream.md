November 14, at 10 AM**,** the Cornerstone church family will offer hybrid worship in the SANCTUARY and via ZOOM.  

Scripture Reading: Matthew 25:14-30

Sermon: Taking Care of God's Treasures

It is a deep joy to celebrate Baptisms with families.  Join us this week for Jeffrey's baptism and celebration of his 1st birthday following the worship service.  It's so wonderful to be extended family in this global world.  Cornerstone is family to those wanting connection.

As a Matthew 25 church, Cornerstone Cares about God's people in each walk of life and seeks to support vibrant ministries that help us eradicate systemic poverty and dismantle structural racism.

**COVID-safe Environment**: join us in the Sanctuary on Overhulse Rd this Sunday in a COVID-safe and friendly environment. We follow all health and safety requirements issued by the CDC.

LOVE GOD, LOVE OTHERS, and SERVE THE WORLD.
