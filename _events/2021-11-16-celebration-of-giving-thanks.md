Can you smell it already? The steamy, juicy, herbed roast turkey; the cinnamon and nutmeg of the pumpkin pie baking in the oven; the freshly baked homemade dinner rolls and bread; your aunts famous green bean casserole; and, the stuffing... mmmm that stuffing. The Thanksgiving feast is quickly approaching. Many people experience deep gratitude this time of year - for family, friends, work, the harvest, food, games, and football. Equally true will be those people for whom this time of year is especially difficult for many varied reasons.

Whether this is a season of joy or a season of sorrow in your life - it helps to focus upon what you are grateful for in your day. We give thanks for the presence and ministry of the Thurston County Food Bank. The Mission Action Team of Cornerstone expresses their gratitude with a quarterly gift and this year a member of the congregation took time in her week during the apple harvest to come pick the best apples from the tree and bring baskets full to the TCFB.  What creative ways are you able to offer thanksgiving for the abundance in your life?

The world continues to journey through a fall season of letting go just as the leaves around us continue to drop their leaves and the winds howl and remove the remainder - there are times of letting go in our lives as well. Sometimes it takes the form of a gentle letting go. Other times, it feels as though our lives are being ripped from what we once knew. The trees here at Cornerstone have almost lost all of their foliage, with the exception of one apple tree whose leaves are hanging on (after the devastating winds from yesterday) into the sunlight of today. They will see a time of rest before the warm light of spring arrives once again. While we are thankful for the vibrant display of color this autumn, watching the trees drop their leaves, becomes an image for what it is like when we experience the changes of the seasons in life. This season of thanksgiving helps us to recognize where in our own lives there may be changes on the horizon and new seasons for which we can look forward.

In Celebration of Giving Thanks, Cornerstone will hold a Thanksgiving Potluck following worship on Sunday, November 28th.  Come celebrate with us all of the marvelous flavors and of the season that can only be experienced because of the letting go and falling into transformation.
