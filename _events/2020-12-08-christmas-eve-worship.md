The Worship Team is currently awaiting recommendations from the Governor to determine appropriate and safe worship opportunities for Christmas Eve'. We are planning to offer a hybrid Christmas Eve' worship experience including worship inside the sanctuary and on ZOOM.  Please stay-tuned to this page as we continue to update you.

Christmas Eve' worship will begin at 5:00 p.m. either on ZOOM alone or as a hybrid including worship in the sanctuary.
