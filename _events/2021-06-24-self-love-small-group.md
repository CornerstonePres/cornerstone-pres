8 week Small Group will be starting Sundays at 11:30 a.m. for one hour

Brene Brown said: "Practicing self-love means learning how to trust ourselves, to treat ourselves with respect, and to be kind and affectionate to ourselves."

Using Megan Logan's "Self-Love Workbook for Women" and incorporating Polyvagal therapeutic practices, we will explore ways to 

* Release Self-Doubt
* Build Self-Compassion
* and, Embrace Who You Are

Workbooks are available on-line for around $20.

**July 18**                  "The Lowdown on Self-Love"
