ALLELUIA! Christ is Risen!

**He is risen indeed, Alleluia!**

Do not seek the living among the dead.

**The Living Lord is Risen. Alleluia!**

Satisfy us with your love, beloved Jesus Christ. We live this day in joy and praise for we will not look for Jesus among the dead, for we believe he is alive and has become the Lord of life. Help us to embrace the gift of life within us. Increase in our minds and hearts the risen life we share with Christ, and help us to grow as your people toward the fullness of eternal life with you, through Christ our Lord. Amen
