O Lord, open my lips. And my mouth shall proclaim your praise. As followers of our Master, Jesus of Nazareth, who shared life and love with us, we come forward to share our lives, our selves, our insights, our energy, our skills and talents, that in so giving and serving others may recognize the love of God.

Join us in worship as we celebrate Holy Communion on this night of the Passover when Jesus would reveal himself to the disciples as the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world that the angel of death will Passover us and we will be led into eternal life.
