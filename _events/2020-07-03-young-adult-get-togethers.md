Are you looking for a group of people to have real conversations about real life from a faith perspective? Do you enjoy modern Christian music? Would you like an evening to socialize or to serve? This Young Adult gathering (Living Stones) will begin meeting this Wednesday night at 6:30 p.m. and the above is what we are all about. Our first Gathering will be August 19 at 6:30 p.m. in a COVID-19 safe outdoor environment at Cornerstone Presbyterian Church. Go to our "About" Page for directions.
