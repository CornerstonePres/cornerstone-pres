This week we are meeting at the Church.



> > > The Thursday night group meets this Thursday, 7:00 p.m. The group is studying the next Eugene Peterson book "A Long Obedience in the Same Direction." This is a study of Psalms 120-134, the Songs of Ascents. We know this will be a deeply meaningful study. Please join us.
