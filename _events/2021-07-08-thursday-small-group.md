Dear Thursday night Bible study,

We are resuming study of Eugene Petersonâ€™s book, Traveling Light. This book is based on Galatians- feel free to join us whether or not you have the book. Elaine will lead us in Chapter 6 of Traveling Light; this is based on Galatians 2:11-21

Here are the Zoom links-also available in the Weekly Wrap.
