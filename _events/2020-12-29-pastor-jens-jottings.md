# **INTRODUCTION:**

I am a life-long learner on a variety of subjects.  I particularly enjoy learning in-depth about scriptures, including from an historical context, a linguistic context, a spiritual context, and a social context. I have found that the most authentic understanding of a writing is to understand it (as much as possible) through the lens of the writer, the circumstances they were facing in the time period from which they wrote and the people to whom they were writing, for that is where the heart, purpose, hoped for outcome, and purest intent finds its seed for propagation (telling forward the truth of the gospel). Scholars who study the scriptures are the most reliable sources of this type of information.

It is my understanding that Matthew's Gospel was written to the Hebrew people to encourage them to place their faith in God that Jesus of Nazareth was and is God's promised Messiah.  Matthew wrote in a particular style for this very specific purpose. His gospel is written in mirror form of the Pentateuch (the first 5 books of the Old Testament in the Christian Bible): Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. Matthew's gospel is written in 5 parts as well.  

For more information I encourage you to read a commentary such as: *The Interpreter's Bible, Interpretation Commentary, Matthew Henry's Commentary, John Calvin's Commentary, or The Reformation Commentary*. There is a long list of commentaries available. If you are a member of Cornerstone and would like more information, Pastor Jen is willing to lend you a commentary. Please speak with her directly.

My personal reflections are updated every Tuesday with reflections on the previous week's readings. I will leave up the reflections for the current month beginning with the most recent. If you would care to read Jen's Jottings from previous months, please contact her and she is happy to email you the archived materials.

Thanks go out to our "Mysterious Guest Jotter" - I hope you enjoyed reading the entry as much as I.  I look forward to having more entries from our Mysterious Guest Jotter in the future.

This week we move out of the Sermon on the Mount and the "commandments" and instructions found in Matthew 5-7. The people were hungry for learning about the lessons to be found in the holy writings (what we call the Old Testament). When Jesus had finished teaching and came down the mount, a "great crowd" followed. They wanted more! More truth and more understanding of the wisdom that is found in the holy writings. 

Can you imagine it? Listening to Jesus talk about the Scriptures I mean. I can imagine people choosing to follow because of the healings and the miracles. The leper that was cleansed, the Centurion's servant who was healed, the many who were  brought to Peter's house.  Word was going out about the man from Nazareth.

My favorite healing narrative is in this section of scripture, The Centurion's Servant. I have such a deep appreciation for the confidence the Centurion places in Jesus even before Jesus agrees to heal. He never expected Jesus to come to his house and lay hands on the servant - "I am not worthy to have you under my roof." This wasn't a fawning of humbleness. He genuinely never expected Jesus to come to his home. "...speak the word, and my servant will be healed."

That's the kind of confidence we can and do have. Each time you raise a prayer of intercession to God, you do so with this kind of confidence that the Triune God will respond and that God's response will be according to God's will - "if you are willing" is a phrase commonly found in the requests which people bring to Christ. 

This is all in accord with the manner in which Jesus taught us to pray earlier in the Sermon on the Mount: "Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven."  

On another tangent, we can invite Jesus into our "house" - our heart - knowing that when we do, Jesus has promised us he will enter.

As you read last week's text, perhaps you had similar thoughts and insights. Where are you in need of inviting Jesus into your "house" and at what places in your life do you feel so assured in Jesus' healing response that you feel confident saying, "Only say the word, and I shall be healed"?

Lov'in  Christ, Pastor Jen



**March 2, 2021 Matthew 6:22-7:8**

**By a Mysterious Guest Jotter**

Jesus has given us a lot of “commandments” in Matthew 5-7 so far: about murder and anger, adultery and divorce, vows and revenge, loving enemies and giving to the poor, fasting and prayer.  Now he is telling us to be contented with what we have and not to worry.  He enjoins us to not be judges of each other, but to look to our own attitudes and behavior.  I don’t know about you, but at this point I’m sinking under the conviction of my own utter inability to do ANY of this.  How in the world can I be the perfect person God wants me to be?

The simple answer is that I can’t.  I am completely incapable of loving my own brothers and sisters, much less my enemies.  How can I survive without worrying, without judging?  What Jesus asks is impossible!

Yes.  It is.  On my own I can’t do any of this.  So now in Matthew 7:7 Jesus directs me to the One Who Sees Me, the One Who Hears Me, the All Mighty, the Creator of the world, my Rock, my Hiding Place, my Savior.

Ask.  Seek.  Knock.  Run to the One who can transform us, make us into the people He created us to be, into the image of His Son. 

“For EVERYONE who asks, receives; she who seeks, finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened.” 

 Grab that promise!

May God's Word bless and feed you this day and each day you carry these thoughts with you in mind and spirit.

Love in Christ, Pastor Jen
