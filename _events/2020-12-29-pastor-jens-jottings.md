REFLECTIONS ON THE READING OF THE GOSPEL OF MATTHEW: Prologue

I like learning about scripture from an historical context. I have found that the most authentic understanding of a writing is to understand it (as much as possible) through the lens of the writer, the circumstances they were facing in the time period from which they wrote, and the people to whom they were writing for that is where the heart, purpose, hope for outcome, and purest intent finds its seed for propagation (telling forth the truth of the gospel). Scholars who study the scriptures are the most reliable source of this type of information.

It is my understanding that Matthew's Gospel was written to the Hebrew people to encourage them to place their faith in God that Jesus of Nazareth was and is God's promised Messiah.  Matthew wrote in a particular style for this very specific purpose. His gospel is written in a mirror from of the Pentateuch (the first 5 books of the Old Testament in the Christian Bible): Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. Matthew's gospel is written in 5 parts as well.  

For more information I encourage you to read a commentary such as: *The Interpreter's Bible, Interpretation Commentary, Matthew Henry's Commentary, John Calvin's Commentary*. There is a long list of commentaries available. If you are a member of Cornerstone and would like more information, Pastor Jen is willing to lend you a commentary. Please speak with her directly.

I will update this page every Tuesday with reflections on the previous week's readings. For example: Tuesday, January 5, I will include reflections from the readings for January 1-4, 2021; and, January 12, I will include reflections from the readings for January 5-11, 2021.  I will **date the entry** below.
