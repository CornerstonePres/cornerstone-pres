REFLECTIONS ON THE READING OF THE GOSPEL OF MATTHEW: Chapter 4:10 to Chapter 5:5

INTRODUCTION:

I am a life-long learner on a variety of subjects.  I particularly enjoy learning in-depth about scriptures, including from an historical context, a linguistic context, a spiritual context, and a social context. I have found that the most authentic understanding of a writing is to understand it (as much as possible) through the lens of the writer, the circumstances they were facing in the time period from which they wrote and the people to whom they were writing, for that is where the heart, purpose, hoped for outcome, and purest intent finds its seed for propagation (telling forward the truth of the gospel). Scholars who study the scriptures are the most reliable sources of this type of information.

It is my understanding that Matthew's Gospel was written to the Hebrew people to encourage them to place their faith in God that Jesus of Nazareth was and is God's promised Messiah.  Matthew wrote in a particular style for this very specific purpose. His gospel is written in mirror form of the Pentateuch (the first 5 books of the Old Testament in the Christian Bible): Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. Matthew's gospel is written in 5 parts as well.  

For more information I encourage you to read a commentary such as: *The Interpreter's Bible, Interpretation Commentary, Matthew Henry's Commentary, John Calvin's Commentary, or The Reformation Commentary*. There is a long list of commentaries available. If you are a member of Cornerstone and would like more information, Pastor Jen is willing to lend you a commentary. Please speak with her directly.

My personal reflections are updated every Tuesday with reflections on the previous week's readings. I will leave up the reflections for the current month beginning with the most recent. If you would care to read Jen's Jottings from previous months, please contact her and she is happy to email you the archived materials.

**February 2, 2021**  Matthew 4:10 to 5:5

"Get away from me Satan"

*The Interpreter's Dictionary of the Bible* \[1990. Abingdon Press, Nashville, TN]  devotes 4 pages to defining this one word - Satan. "The instigator of all evil; the rival of God; the Antichrist; the archfiend; the chief of the devils \[p. 224]." The Hebrew root of the word primarily means "obstruct or oppose" \[ibid. 224]. Understanding the grammatical uses of the word helps us to understand what the name denotes. The name in the Old Testament is used to denote the obstruction of a person's path (Num. 22:22), the opposition in battle (1 Sam. 29:4), the legal adversary in the Psalms and the cognative form of the Hebrew word root gives us the nouns "hatred" and "hostility" in Hosea 9:7 \[ibid. 224].

When the Old Testament was translated into the Latin Septuagint a grammatical transition was made to treating the word as a proper name. In the Hebrew Scriptures (the Old Testament) the word is never a proper name representative of a demonic figure who is responsible for all evil.  This is important for us to note as often times in modern culture evil is personified in such a manner.  The word is rather a title for any occurance that is in opposition to God's will by way of obstructing God's purposes on earth - so more like a title such as doctor, miss, mister, etcetera.

In the Old Testament book of Job, the Hebrew is translated as "the satan" in contrast to a name "Satan" \[ibid., 224]. The word means "the one who acts as accuser, or prosecuting attorney, on a given occasion \[ibid. 225]."  I like what the dictionary had to say after explaining this important yet subtle difference: "It is not implied that this is his constant name or role, nor even that he is inherently evil. Moreover, far from being the antagonist of God and the chief of a rival dominion, he is his subordinate and can act only with his consent and in accordance with his orders."

So that, when we say to the Lord, "Test me and see that my heart is good," we ought to be aware that we are asking God to open the way for the accusers to come at us on any given occasion.  Having tried this myself in the past, I can tell you, you will receive the full force of that which will tempt you personally for the Lord to see if your heart is indeed pure. "Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God \[Matthew 5:8]." 

And so, we have Jesus being tempted by the accuser.  Remember that Jesus was sent or driven by the Holy Spirit out into the wilderness for the holy purpose to be tempted to sin in body, mind, and soul.  And upon addressing each type of temptation, responded appropriately with, "Away from me Satan!" 

The realization that Jesus has supplied you and I with the words needed to put behind us all of our own temptations, assists us in taking hold of a true perspective and shows us the absolute way of resisting. "And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil" takes on a complete understanding of the term and its application in your and my every day living.

Jesus has provided you and I with the language needed to put temptation behind us and has empowered us to move forward as godly sons and daughters of the Most High.

May God's Word bless and feed you this day and each day you carry these thoughts with you in mind and spirit.

Love in Christ, Pastor Jen
