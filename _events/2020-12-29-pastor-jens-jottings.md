**March 2, 2021 Matthew 6:22-7:8**

**By a Mysterious Guest Jotter**

Jesus has given us a lot of “commandments” in Matthew 5-7 so far: about murder and anger, adultery and divorce, vows and revenge, loving enemies and giving to the poor, fasting and prayer.  Now he is telling us to be contented with what we have and not to worry.  He enjoins us to not be judges of each other, but to look to our own attitudes and behavior.  I don’t know about you, but at this point I’m sinking under the conviction of my own utter inability to do ANY of this.  How in the world can I be the perfect person God wants me to be?

The simple answer is that I can’t.  I am completely incapable of loving my own brothers and sisters, much less my enemies.  How can I survive without worrying, without judging?  What Jesus asks is impossible!

Yes.  It is.  On my own I can’t do any of this.  So now in Matthew 7:7 Jesus directs me to the One Who Sees Me, the One Who Hears Me, the All Mighty, the Creator of the world, my Rock, my Hiding Place, my Savior.

Ask.  Seek.  Knock.  Run to the One who can transform us, make us into the people He created us to be, into the image of His Son. 

“For EVERYONE who asks, receives; she who seeks, finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened.” 

 Grab that promise!



REFLECTIONS ON THE READING OF THE GOSPEL OF MATTHEW:

 **Chapter 5:28-48**

INTRODUCTION:

I am a life-long learner on a variety of subjects.  I particularly enjoy learning in-depth about scriptures, including from an historical context, a linguistic context, a spiritual context, and a social context. I have found that the most authentic understanding of a writing is to understand it (as much as possible) through the lens of the writer, the circumstances they were facing in the time period from which they wrote and the people to whom they were writing, for that is where the heart, purpose, hoped for outcome, and purest intent finds its seed for propagation (telling forward the truth of the gospel). Scholars who study the scriptures are the most reliable sources of this type of information.

It is my understanding that Matthew's Gospel was written to the Hebrew people to encourage them to place their faith in God that Jesus of Nazareth was and is God's promised Messiah.  Matthew wrote in a particular style for this very specific purpose. His gospel is written in mirror form of the Pentateuch (the first 5 books of the Old Testament in the Christian Bible): Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. Matthew's gospel is written in 5 parts as well.  

For more information I encourage you to read a commentary such as: *The Interpreter's Bible, Interpretation Commentary, Matthew Henry's Commentary, John Calvin's Commentary, or The Reformation Commentary*. There is a long list of commentaries available. If you are a member of Cornerstone and would like more information, Pastor Jen is willing to lend you a commentary. Please speak with her directly.

My personal reflections are updated every Tuesday with reflections on the previous week's readings. I will leave up the reflections for the current month beginning with the most recent. If you would care to read Jen's Jottings from previous months, please contact her and she is happy to email you the archived materials.

**February 23, 2021** Matthew 6:1-21

We’ve all been there.  We’ve each done it – sought out attention. Sometimes attention seeking is positive and sometimes negative. There is an old saying in treatment center circles, “Negative attention is better than no attention.” So when a person experiences neglect or is missing positive attention from someone they look up to, they will act out, become angry, set their teeth on edge against you, sabotage you or themselves, in order to get your attention. You can notice the same types of behaviors in your pets. Typically a person does so without even realizing that is what they are doing. And it stems back to this need we have for belonging and love. However, that choice often does not result in the positive feedback we crave. “Is that choice helpful or harmful?” then becomes the question. 

Jesus acknowledges people’s penchant for attention seeking behavior in religious circles too. We gravitate toward the misconception that when others witness our good acts, acts of kindness, benevolent acts we will receive an eternal reward.  The accolades or perceived approval rewards our brain center. This is a positive result we want to pursue as it encourages us to continue to carry out such actions.  So, it is imperative to my thinking to point out what Jesus IS saying and what Jesus is NOT saying in our verses for last week so that we have a proper context.

In the context of Matthew 6:1, 5, 16, 19-21 \[all scripture quotes are from the NIV]

* “Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.”
* “And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly, I tell you, they have received their reward in full.”
* “When you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
* “Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.”

Jesus is encouraging his followers to realize that their *motivation* for doing these acts is important. His point is – do not participate in these behaviors “for show”. A good way to test your motivation is to engage in your giving at times without anyone knowing how it is you have supplied the needs of another "do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing" \[Mt. 6:3]; without anyone knowing what your positive conversations are for a person you are struggling with for example \[Mt. 6:6-8]; without showing the depths of your devotion to God \[Mt. 6:17-18] but instead: to give, to pray, to fast in ways that only God will see.

By focusing your motivation upon devotional love for God, you will experience longer-lasting and greater reward than in those times your motivation is to impress others. \[Mt. 6:19-21] "Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destory, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."

Let your spiritual practice this week include giving financially, praying, and fasting in ways that only you and God know about and share the results you notice with us on our Facebook page: <https://www.facebook.com/CornerstonePresOly>

**February 16, 2021** Matthew 5:28-48

It has been an oft too common practice in religious circles to misinterpret the scriptures read for last week.  I would be intrigued to learn what your personal reflections and thoughts are. Any who take time to read these reflections will soon know my reflections regarding the context.

Were we to read the above listed verses in Chapter 5, in an isolated reading, we might come to an incomplete conclusion of the main point of Jesus’ sayings in this text.  Verses 27-48 begin with illustrative scenarios for the statement he makes in verses 17-20 regarding his being the fulfillment of the Law.  Last week I addressed verse 19 in particular (“Therefore, anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commandments and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.” \[NIV])

Jesus shows “You have heard it said … “ \[NIV vs. 21] to be a phrase he used to set before the listener a teaching through a list of examples with which they are already familiar. It is like saying, “you know how it is” in modern vernacular.  Jesus is making an emphatic point to show that there is not one single person who has not committed sin – whether in word, deed, or THOUGHT. He states that if you say the simplest insult – "You’re a fool," as an example – you have committed murder in your heart toward that person.  How many people have you and I murdered when taking that saying literally?

Jesus’ point is that ALL are in need of repenting for their sins and ALL are in need of God’s grace and forgiveness.

Jesus’ next prominent line is to support the point that aligns with love your neighbor as yourself – “Settle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court.” In other words, if you know someone has a legitimate experience of your sin against them, go and clear up the matter, apologize, and offer steps for reconciliation.  If you have harmed someone and do not, and they have a case against you in the afterlife, God will hold you accountable for what is left unsettled or unrepaired.

Then moving into the text for last week: Matthew 5:28-48 the subjects of Adultery, Divorce, and Oaths are in the same context as those just now discussed. They are examples for the point Jesus is making.

Beginning in verse 43, we hear Jesus get to the point – “love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. If you love those who love, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? And if you greet only your own people, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that? Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.” \[NIV]

This does NOT mean that we excuse the inappropriate behavior of another.  It DOES mean that we are to love everyone, especially those who are hardest on us.  We are to pray for them. There is a saying I learned while working in treatment centers – “hurt people, hurt people.” If someone is attempting to hurt you, it comes from a deep place in their heart of having been wounded by others first. Most times, they are not even aware of their own wounded spirit: they lash out, typically with words meant to hurt you through personal insults; to diminish you in the eyes of others by putting you down or mocking or discrediting you in some way; to take away from you the opportunity to share the spiritual gifts through which your godly light shines; and/or, to emotionally manipulate you or sabotage the efforts you make. If any of this sounds familiar to you, I encourage you to seek out pastoral support for your spiritual journey with persecution.

Jesus is saying what you already know – it is easy to love those who love you; to spend time with people who are “your tribe”; and/or, to bless those who bless you.  Everyone, regardless of one’s belief and faith system, does this because it is *human nature*. One of our mind’s hierarchal needs is *BELONGING*.  Jesus reminds you that if this approach to love were a reflection of Godly love, none of us would ever make it to God’s heavenly realm. 

God’s love reaches out to you and I (who are the enemy of God because we sin against God) regardless of our status as an enemy of God. This is the reason he used all of those examples – to drive home his point on God’s forgiving grace. You and I are living in godliness when we choose likewise to forgive and to love in the same way as God loves and forgives us.

Won’t you have courage my friend – the courage Jesus had – to forgive those who hurt you; to pray for those who make your life tough or unpleasant and thus be like your Father in Heaven and be called “Child of God”?

**February 9, 2021** Matthew 5:6-27

"Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven." \[Matthew 5:19-20, NIV]

Three phrases in these two verses have taken hold of my attention today.

1. "will be called least in the kingdom of heaven";
2. "will be called great in the kingdom of heaven"; and,
3. "will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven."

I notice that my thoughts instinctively begin to sort and attempt to discern the outcome of my life - to which group will I belong? Another thought arising goes to the question: what is at the heart of Jesus' teaching in these phrases. The kingdom of heaven is a conceptualization of the kingdom of God. So upon which does Scripture encourage a person to focus?

Rabbinic teaching thought of God's sovereignty as "a divine discipline to be accepted by individuals by obedient submission to God's will [*The Interpreter's Dictionary of the Bible*, vol. 3, p. 20]."  This is certainly reflected in Jesus' saying above: those who are obedient to God's Law and to teaching it in all walks of life will be called (by whom?) "great in the kingdom of heaven" and this is appealing to our human competitive nature to have a high view of one's self. This high view of one's self was a point Jesus often addressed, and in fact addressed in his teaching in the Sermon on the Mount (refer to Matthew 6:1; 6:16ff; 7:1-6).  

The conceptualization of God's kingdom as an ideal to be taken upon by a person and carried with them was a common contemporary thought in Jesus' time. Jesus was well aware of the various ways the people conceived the idea. And in this passage is subtly addressing the difficulties found therein if one truly knows God. Jesus' predominant use in this lesson is an eschatological one - it regards the kingdom that is to come.

Understanding and grasping the view of the people in Jesus' time and having insight into Jesus' conception, are imperative to our own understanding when reading of the passage above. Jesus acknowledges in this teaching both the common view people held and his teaching about God's kingdom being one of grace and forgiveness - a resurrection kingdom. Then we can see the point Jesus is making: you can only be called great in the kingdom of heaven if your own actions exceed those who view themselves as perfect in carrying out the Ten Commandments; knowing this is impossible, we realize that we are indeed, each and everyone, the least in the kingdom of heaven because we fail to uphold God's law in every way (Jesus will then drive home his point by showing us we sin even when we do not carry out the action - one does not have to commit murder to be a murderer in God's eye for if you even do the smallest thing such as THINK someone is without capability of thinking "correctly" you have committed murder in your heart already). Thus the point Jesus is making becomes clear - we will enter the kingdom of heaven by God's grace and forgiveness alone. We will enter the kingdom of heaven through God's Son, the Messiah who forgives the sins of the world. 

During the season of Lent, followers of Jesus (Christians), are encouraged to examine their daily living, to repent for the sin against others, God, and self and to return to the ways of God the Father, as a child follows the example of their parent/s or care-givers ("the fruit doesn't fall far from the tree").  May you have the bold courage to be honest with your own self about your need for God's forgiveness and humbly seek it out.

Have mercy upon us Lord, in Jesus' name. Amen.

The peace, grace, and love of our Lord Jesus Christ be yours today and always. Pastor Jen

**February 2, 2021**  Matthew 4:10 to 5:5

"Get away from me Satan"

*The Interpreter's Dictionary of the Bible* \[1990. Abingdon Press, Nashville, TN]  devotes 4 pages to defining this one word - Satan. "The instigator of all evil; the rival of God; the Antichrist; the archfiend; the chief of the devils \[p. 224]." The Hebrew root of the word primarily means "obstruct or oppose" \[ibid. 224]. Understanding the grammatical uses of the word helps us to understand what the name denotes. The name in the Old Testament is used to denote the obstruction of a person's path (Num. 22:22), the opposition in battle (1 Sam. 29:4), the legal adversary in the Psalms and the cognative form of the Hebrew word root gives us the nouns "hatred" and "hostility" in Hosea 9:7 \[ibid. 224].

When the Old Testament was translated into the Latin Septuagint a grammatical transition was made to treating the word as a proper name. In the Hebrew Scriptures (the Old Testament) the word is never a proper name representative of a demonic figure who is responsible for all evil.  This is important for us to note as often times in modern culture evil is personified in such a manner.  The word is rather a title for any occurance that is in opposition to God's will by way of obstructing God's purposes on earth - so more like a title such as doctor, miss, mister, etcetera.

In the Old Testament book of Job, the Hebrew is translated as "the satan" in contrast to a name "Satan" \[ibid., 224]. The word means "the one who acts as accuser, or prosecuting attorney, on a given occasion \[ibid. 225]."  I like what the dictionary had to say after explaining this important yet subtle difference: "It is not implied that this is his constant name or role, nor even that he is inherently evil. Moreover, far from being the antagonist of God and the chief of a rival dominion, he is his subordinate and can act only with his consent and in accordance with his orders."

So that, when we say to the Lord, "Test me and see that my heart is good," we ought to be aware that we are asking God to open the way for the accusers to come at us on any given occasion.  Having tried this myself in the past, I can tell you, you will receive the full force of that which will tempt you personally for the Lord to see if your heart is indeed pure. "Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God \[Matthew 5:8]." 

And so, we have Jesus being tempted by the accuser.  Remember that Jesus was sent or driven by the Holy Spirit out into the wilderness for the holy purpose to be tempted to sin in body, mind, and soul.  And upon addressing each type of temptation, responded appropriately with, "Away from me Satan!" 

The realization that Jesus has supplied you and I with the words needed to put behind us all of our own temptations, assists us in taking hold of a true perspective and shows us the absolute way of resisting. "And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil" takes on a complete understanding of the term and its application in your and my every day living.

Jesus has provided you and I with the language needed to put temptation behind us and has empowered us to move forward as godly sons and daughters of the Most High.

May God's Word bless and feed you this day and each day you carry these thoughts with you in mind and spirit.

Love in Christ, Pastor Jen
