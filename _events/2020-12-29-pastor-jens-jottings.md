# **INTRODUCTION:**

I am a person who enjoys life-long learning on a variety of subjects.  I particularly enjoy learning in-depth about scriptures, including from an historical context, a linguistic context, a spiritual context, and a social context. I have found that the most authentic understanding of a writing is to understand it (as much as possible) through the lens of the original writer, the circumstances they were facing in the time period from which they wrote and the people to whom they were writing, for that is where the heart, purpose, hoped for outcome, and purest intent finds its seed for propagation (telling forward the truth of the gospel). Scholars who study the scriptures are the most reliable sources of this type of information. 

For more information I encourage you to read a commentary such as: *The Interpreter's Bible, Interpretation Commentary, Matthew Henry's Commentary, John Calvin's Commentary, or The Reformation Commentary*. There is a long list of commentaries available. If you are a member of Cornerstone and would like more information, I am willing to lend you a commentary.

Matthew's Gospel was written to the Hebrew people to encourage them to place their faith in God who sent Jesus of Nazareth to be God's promised Messiah.  Matthew wrote in a particular style for this very specific purpose. His gospel is written in mirror form of the Pentateuch (the first 5 books of the Old Testament in the Christian Bible): Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. Matthew's gospel is written in 5 parts as well. 

My personal reflections of the previous week's readings are updated every Tuesday. If you would care to read Jen's Jottings from previous months, please contact me: pastor@cornerstonepres.net. I am happy to email you the archived materials.

May God's Word bless and feed you this day and each day you carry these thoughts with you in mind and spirit.

Love in Christ, Pastor Jen

**May 11, 2021** Matthew 12:46 - 13:16

The scripture passage listed here is a continuation of the scene from last week.  Some instruction is helpful to understanding the scene. The Pharisees were the segment of religious leadership in Israel and Judah who took on the responsibility of reviving Temple worship after the original Temple and priestly leaders had been destroyed and killed in the Old Testament period of exiles into Babylon and Syria and Assyria as a direct result of conquest and consequences for idolatry. When Jesus was alive, the Pharisees and the Sadducees were seeking to disprove Jesus’ Messianic role, as it would mean their own ruin. Feeling their power threatened, they sought ways to discredit Jesus.  This passage is a primary example of this bullying behavior.

In this extended passage, the Pharisees who are present take hold of an opportunity to discredit Jesus when he cures a demoniac who was blind and mute, by claiming Jesus was only able to do so because he was an agent of a demon himself. In confident reply, Jesus points out that a house divided cannot stand. Jesus points out the fallacy of the statement, “Why would Satan cast out Satan? He would lose his power.” Jesus then continues to point out the fallacy of their logic and vehemently and emphatically states that their words reveal their heart. In fact, the Pharisees (not all Pharisees) making those statements were actually saying that the Holy Spirit was a demon.  So Jesus tells them, “Look! You can say anything you want about me. My role as Savior will forgive you. But when you claim that I’ve cured through the power of Beelzebul, when in fact it is by the power of the Holy Spirit, then you are in fact saying that the Holy Spirit is Beelzebul and THAT is blasphemy and will be punishable as such.”

Jesus’ next comments in verses 33-37 are his use of imagery to drive home his point. Your heart, your thoughts, your words are evil when the result (the fruit or the produce) is harmful to another person. And just like a tree – your soul is either good or bad (that is not to say forgivable or unforgivable that is a separate concept) – the fruit of your words and actions are either good or evil.  Jesus is telling those Pharisees present in that moment that they are showing themselves to be the bad fruit for blaspheming against the Holy Spirit.  Jesus warns them that they have used careless words and they will experience the consequences of that.

In last week’s set of readings we now move into chapter 13. Here we find Jesus later on in that same day (so chapters 12 and 13 took place on the same day). He has walked from that place to the seashore and the crowds are still following him. He has nowhere else to turn as they have pushed him and crowded in on him until he is at the water. So, Jesus gets into a boat to continue teaching the crowd following this confrontation and energy filled with conflict. He takes opportunity to warn them about the type of personality and soul that allows for the spirit of God to work faith in a person nurturing them to faith.

How careful you and I must be with our words too.  “Oh, be careful little mouth what you say. For the Father up above is looking down in love; so, be careful little mouth what you say.” We’re never too old to remember the lessons of our childhood.

May these reflections be an encouragement to you as much as they are an encouragement to myself. Go in peace my friends, to love and serve your Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.  Love, Pastor Jen

**May 4, 2021**  Matthew 12:25-45

My grandmother used to tell me, "Jenny, say what you mean and mean what you say. Be careful what words you choose." I remember a dear friend during my college years choose words very carefully and when I would ask a question about the meaning they were trying to convey the response was always, “I chose my words very carefully. Learn the definitions.”  These statements left an indelible impression upon my mind.  To this day, when I am in a non-anxious frame of mind, I will select my words with some care.  It’s in the heat of a moment, that my lips can be careless.  I imagine you notice the same in your own life.

Here is the thing I am working on realizing in the context of that statement: people, myself included, don't often enough stop to think about what power our words hold. You've all had a friend say to you, "Thanks for listening to me vent," or "thanks for letting me vent." It is true that our mental health and our relationships benefit from not holding in our emotions (especially those we label as "negative emotions"). But we do not always understand that the conveyance of a word brings life to the thought or destroys life with the stated thought.  Why is this important for you and I to accept?

In this passage, Jesus emphatically brings to our attention the truth of the above idea – there is power in your words.  The power to cast out demons was by speaking a name – in this case, the name of God.  Jesus was being accused of casting out demons in the name of Beelzebul. Jesus states contrarily that in fact and in deed Jesus ties up and binds that name in order to cast out the demon.  He then goes on to state in V. 32:

“Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.” He then goes on in verses 34-37 (giving special attention to verses 36-37) “You brood of vipers! How can you speak good things, when you are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. The good person brings good things out of a good treasure, and the evil person brings evil things out of n evil treasure. I tell you, on the day of judgment you will have to given an account for every careless word you utter; for by your words you will justified, and by your words you will be condemned.”

I am reminded, in reflecting on the power of the spoken word, of how Holy Scriptures begin:

(vs. 3) “Then God said, ‘Let there be light’; and there was light. …. (vs. 5) God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. (vs. 6) And God said, ‘Let there be a dome in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.’  … all through the creation story, each day begins with three words “And God said,”  God spoke and creation came into being.

The phrase, “God said” occurs over 600 times in the Scriptures and with each spoken word, what God speaks came to exist, came to be, came to occur.  We as being created in God’s image, must learn to accept that our words convey reality.  The reality you choose to speak, is the reality you create and that reality finds its source in your thoughts and in your heart. SO … “be careful little mouth what you say.”  May these be words of encouragement for you this week as much as they are words of encouragement for me.

Go in peace my friends to love and serve your Lord, Jesus the Christ, with deep regard ~ Pastor Jen
