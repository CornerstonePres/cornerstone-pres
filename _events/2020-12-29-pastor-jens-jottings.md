# **INTRODUCTION:**

I am a person who enjoys life-long learning on a variety of subjects.  I particularly enjoy learning in-depth about scriptures, including from an historical context, a linguistic context, a spiritual context, and a social context. I have found that the most authentic understanding of a writing is to understand it (as much as possible) through the lens of the original writer, the circumstances they were facing in the time period from which they wrote and the people to whom they were writing, for that is where the heart, purpose, hoped for outcome, and purest intent finds its seed for propagation (telling forward the truth of the gospel). Scholars who study the scriptures are the most reliable sources of this type of information. 

For more information I encourage you to read a commentary such as: *The Interpreter's Bible, Interpretation Commentary, Matthew Henry's Commentary, John Calvin's Commentary, or The Reformation Commentary*. There is a long list of commentaries available. If you are a member of Cornerstone and would like more information, I am willing to lend you a commentary.

Matthew's Gospel was written to the Hebrew people to encourage them to place their faith in God who sent Jesus of Nazareth to be God's promised Messiah.  Matthew wrote in a particular style for this very specific purpose. His gospel is written in mirror form of the Pentateuch (the first 5 books of the Old Testament in the Christian Bible): Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. Matthew's gospel is written in 5 parts as well. 

My personal reflections of the previous week's readings are updated every Tuesday. If you would care to read Jen's Jottings from previous months, please contact me: pastor@cornerstonepres.net. I am happy to email you the archived materials.

May God's Word bless and feed you this day and each day you carry these thoughts with you in mind and spirit.

Love in Christ, Pastor Jen

**JUNE 1, 2021**  Matthew 14:1-21

Matthew presents this interlude in the journey of Jesus to further his description from the end of Chapter 13 to point out the level of rejection and verbal persecution Jesus was undergoing by all of the leadership in Israel and Judah.  He was rejected by the Pharisees and Saducess. He was rejected by his home town. And now, Herod the ruler threatens Jesus again based on a false claim (that Jesus was the reincarnation of John the Baptists who was murdered in essence at the hands of Herod through the deception of his sister-in-law/wife and niece/step-daughter).

Jesus' response to opposition was to teach the disciples that the weeds must be allowed to grow with the fruit; otherwise, if one attempts to pull up the weeds, the fruit might be damaged in the process.  It is better to let the weeds grow alongside the plant you are harvesting from Jesus' perspective.

The other response Jesus typically used was to state the woe for those who opposed and then to quietly move on to another location and continue to good works and spreading of the good news that God's kingdom was at hand.  Those who were open to receiving Jesus' words discovered their blessing and those in opposition knew no better and gained nothing either by listening or by objecting to Jesus.

This sets for us an example of how to approach the people who oppose us as well. Bless them. Let the opposition be present. Do not give negativity \[whether through people or circumstances of the day] your mental, emotional, or spiritual energy.  Address the issues, always address important issues with firmness, as positively as you are able.  Address the person/people with as much kindness as possible.

When Jesus heard that Herod thought Jesus was the reincarnated John the Baptist, and he recalled Herod's treatment of John as described in Matthew's gospel, "he withdrew from there by boat to a deserted place by himself. But when the crowds heard it, they followed him on foot from the towns. When he went ashore, he saw a great crowd; and he had compassion for them and cured their sick."

Jesus withdrew after the bombardment of verbal accusations, personal attacks upon his character, his integrity, his authority, and his role ~ and was exhausted!!!  Be a fountain in people's lives. Seek to fill them instead of a drain on their energy.  Seek to bless and to not be a toxic negative presence in another person's life. And if you happen to be on the receiving end of a toxic relationship - consider if it is time for you also to withdraw to a solitude place with God. Recover your spirit, refill your energy. Don't negatively create drama thinking you will feel better about your self. That is what Herod was doing. Creating drama out of his own issues and projecting them onto Jesus - who was not part of Herod's drama by choice to begin with. Herod was the source of Herod's own problems and drama.  I encourage you my friends, if you are the creator of drama in the life of people around you - they are not the problem. Be a part of the solution.

Go in peace my friends to love and serve your Lord, Jesus the Christ, with deep regard ~ Pastor Jen
