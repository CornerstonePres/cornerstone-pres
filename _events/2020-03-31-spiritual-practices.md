SPIRITUAL PRACTICE for the week of September 1-7: ***Taking Time to Notice***

During the past several months we, as a people, have experienced much to grieve: tragic unnecessary loss of life through disease and violence; loss of normality; loss of livelihood; loss of confidence in our cultural systems; and, lamentation regarding the health of the planet (hurricanes, fires, drought, climatic changes). When you feel bombarded and overwhelmed by the events of this earthly life which surround you, ***take time to notice***.

Earlier this year I was observing the anniversary of my eldest sibling's death. Her favorite symbolic creation was the dragonfly. The dragonfly reminded me of God's transforming power that makes all things new and which makes us all into new creations. As with many people whose loved one has passed, we often notice their favorite bird or their favorite creation and are reminded of their presence in our life.

I was grieving the morning of the anniversary when my daughter called. She noticed my sadness and said, "I hope you see a dragonfly today."

The afternoon was bright and sunny despite my grief. I decided to take a walk that afternoon and get a dose of sun and scenery. Midway through the walk I was looking down at my dog sniffing the smells all around him - noticing what other creatures had left their scent, when I noticed a shadow on the pavement. The shadow was of a giant dragonfly. As my gaze wandered up, I spotted it directly in front of me. It hovered there for a few moments before zipping away in search of what it would notice in its existence.

Our time here is brief my friends. I hope you ***take time to notice*** God's love for you during the times you take to notice this week.
