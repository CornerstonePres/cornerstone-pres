TODAY's SPIRITUAL PRACTICE: Expressing Yourself to God

You can make this practice as simple or as special as pleases you. 

Supplies: something to write with and something to write on. 

Mark your writing material with whatever is the first thing to come to mind (a word, a sentence, a phrase, a feeling, a name, an image).

Focus only on what you marked down.  Notice what comes to your mind. 

You might choose to write God a letter about it. You might choose to lift up a prayer to God regarding what it is about. You might choose to meditate on the word or image and draw or doodle or color around the word.  Play with this practice and have fun as you become aware of God's Holy Spirit in this space with you interceding on your behalf.

NIV - Romans 8:26 "Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we ought, but that very Spirit intercedes with sighs too deep for words."
