SPIRITUAL PRACTICE for the week of October 20-26: SPIRITUAL JOURNAL

Supplies: writing tool, paper, computer notepad, quiet space

The practice of writing about your personal spiritual journey will help you to notice God's activity and hand in your life. The prompting of the Holy Spirit will awaken your awareness of those places in your life and relationships that God is inviting you receive pruning so that your life may bear abundant fruit and grow the spiritual lives of those around you. 

Spiritual Journal prompt: God is always present to you. God is all around you and is in you at all times. You have but to tke a moment to to breathe in and out, to listen to the sound of your heart beat; to hear the crackle of the fire in your room. write down 5 things you notice about your surroundings:

1. what do you hear?
2. what can you see?
3. what taste is in your mouth?
4. what do you smell?
5. what is supporting your body?
6. Where is your body touching a surface and what does that feel like?
7. listen to the silence around you
8. allow your mind to focus on only one subject - what was the first thing you noticed?

Take the next 5 minutes to listen, allowing your thoughts to wander, perhaps visualize your favorite walk, your favorite place to relax. What is God's voice inviting you to notice in this moment? Write down your thoughts and any conversation you hear inside your heart, then read it again for the purpose of noticing a point in which you might be asking for healing, encouragement, growth, or personal power. See it and understand this is the work of God within you. The peace of our Lord, Jesus Christ, be with you today and always.
