This week's SPIRITUAL PRACTICE: the Breath Prayer

This spiritual practice can be as long or short in duration as you choose. The use of a breath prayer in your regular spiritual practices encourages the practioner to pause in the day. 

Begin by finding a quiet space with no distractions. Close your eyes if this helps you to exclude any visual distractions. Take a deep breath focusing your mind into the lower back side of your ribcage for a count of 4, pause, release the breath for a count of 4. Do this a few times as you clear any thoughts. As an imagery assist - acknowledge the thought, visualize yourself opening the door and escorting the thought out, close the door.

Choose a phrase (4 words or fewer) or a singular word - The peace of Christ, The Love of God, Grace, Patience, Forgiveness - as examples.  Breathe in while thinking the phrase or the word. Pause. Breathe out. Do this until you feel centered and focused. 

Choose a phrase again - breathe in; pause; think the phrase or word as you breathe out. Repeat this cycle until you feel calm, centered and focused.
