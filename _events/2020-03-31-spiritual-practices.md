SPIRITUAL PRACTICE for the week of May 26-June 1: Practical Spirituality

Next week the church celebrates the remembrance of Pentecost - the giving of the Holy Spirit to the church.  The giving of the Holy Spirit to the church was an initiating event in Christianity. Many consider it the "birthday" of the Church universal. 

In John's gospel chapter 20 verses 19 through 23 \[John 20:19-23] this week we read about the moment the 11 disciples received the gift of the Holy Spirit from the mouth of Jesus.

\    "On the evening of that first day of the week, when the disciples were together, with the doors locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said, "Peace be with you!" After he said this, he showed them his hands and side. The disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord.

\    "Again Jesus said, 'Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I am sending you.' And with that he breathed on them and said, 'Receive the HOly Spirit. If you forgive anyone his sins, they are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven.' \[NIV]

Jesus breathed the Holy Spirit upon them for a very practical purpose - that they would be sent into the world with the anointing, power, and Spirit of God upon them.  Jesus promises you that when you believe on him and are baptized, you too are sealed by the power of the Holy Spirit and in receipt of Spiritual gifts. These gifts from God are not to be hoarded, stored, or hidden but are to be put into practical use.

This week for your spiritual practice take courage, be bold, and share with us at Cornerstonepres218@gmail.com your experiences of what happened as you put into practice your spiritual muscle.
