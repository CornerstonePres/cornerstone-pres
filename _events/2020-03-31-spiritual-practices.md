TODAY's SPIRITUAL PRACTICE: Prayer Walk

Walking the Labyrinth is an ancient spiritual practice of the Christian faith. Anyone is welcome to come to our church and walk the outdoor labyrinth as seen in the photo. If you prefer you may use your index finger and your device screen to trace the path. A labyrinth is different from a maze in that there is one continuous path that leads a participant to the center. Much like breathing, the path will wind in toward the center and out toward the edge before reaching the center where one spends time in reflection, meditation, scripture reading, or prayer. Then one makes the journey back into the world. During this time of social distancing may you experience the closeness of God, Christ, and the Holy Spirit. Peace and blessings.
