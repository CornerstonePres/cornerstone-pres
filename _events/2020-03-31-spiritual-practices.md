This week's SPIRITUAL PRACTICE: Prayers of Intercession and Supplication

Intercession is defined by Webster's as: "the action of intervening on behalf of another."

Supplication is defined by Webster's as: "the action of asking or begging for something earnestly and humbly."

We encourage you to choose a specific time each day this week in lifting up prayers for others. Spend time with each matter being raised in prayer to the Lord. Make your prayer personal and specific in conversation with God's Holy Spirit. Conclude your prayer time on that item with the phrase provided.

Prayers for the World ... Lord in your mercy, hear my prayer.

Prayers for the Church and people of faith ... In your mercy, Lord, hear my prayer.

Prayers for the national life ...  Merciful Lord, hear my prayer.

Prayers for family and personal life ... Lord in your mercy, hear my prayer.

Prayers for those who are sick ... In your mercy, Lord, hear my prayer.

Prayers for those who suffer ... Merciful Lord, hear my prayer.
