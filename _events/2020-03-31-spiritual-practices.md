SPIRITUAL PRACTICE for the week of May 19-25: CONTEMPLATION 

Contemplation on God's Suffering

Empathy is one of the most powerful perspectives of a human being. The ability to put yourself in someone else's shoes allows you to see each situation from another perspective. It is the top quality of all good leadership. In Emotional Intelligence it is the prime indicator and factor of leadership ability and is a skill that you are able to acquire practically.

We too often do not take time to allow ourselves to be aware of this most powerful quality of God - God is most empathic having been through everything we've been through first. Yes! Everything! To see God in one simple light - all powerful, all-knowing, all-encompassing - dismisses God's own suffering and how God views suffering and it's connection to godly love.

Read 1 Peter 4:12-19 and set aside time each day this week to acknowledge before God how God has suffered and what makes God suffer. Perhaps write your insights in prayer form.

Father in heaven, you have known betrayal and heart break when those whom you love do not return love to you (Exodus). You understand the suffering of patience when you wait for your child to return to you (Prodigal Father). You have suffered like a  spouse whose mate is unfaithful (Hosae). You have been beaten by those whom you love because they did not want to hear what you had to say (the prophets). You have given and given and given of your self without being apreciated or thanked. You have known your people's hunger and thirst and provided for them when they complain without receiving anything in return. You have died for your children in hopes they would come to you. When I see suffering in my lifetime - may I always be aware that it is you who is suffering and may I choose to ease your suffering Abba (daddy). Amen.
