SPIRITUAL PRACTICE for the week of June 2-8: Practical Spirituality

What do those words mean exactly - Practical Spirituality.

A person's spirituality is the individual expression of their engagement with the divine. This in contrast but not opposition to religion which is the gathering of individuals with similar beliefs to corporately worship the divine. Spiritual people most often practice their spirituality internally through the inward journey of exploring one's faith and belief systems. 

"Practical Spirituality" as I have coined the phrase, means taking the next outward step based on Christian practices of spiritual truths. This is the healthy balance of the Pauline Johannine "faith versus works" argument. The truth of the matter is, as most of us understand and accept, that it is neither faith alone nor works alone that completes the expression of Christian spiritual truths in the lives of believers. It is a balance of both being and doing that completes the picture - this is PRACTICAL SPIRITUALITY ("where the rubber meets the road" as they say). We are scripturally required to do both - "God has shown you, O mortal, what is good. And what does the LORD require of you but to act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God?" \[Micah 6:8 NIV]

Each morning ask the Lord, "What would you have me do in service to you this today Lord?" This is a practical expression of your inward spiritual seeking. Then be open and available in your plans and schedule to accommodate any interruption that comes in which you recognize opportunity to serve the God-head: God's creation of the opportunity; Christ's teachings about what it is to love; and, the empowerment of the Holy Spirit to accomplish the task. 

Serving Christ together in Faith, Hope, and Love and the greatest of these is LOVE ~ Pastor Jen
