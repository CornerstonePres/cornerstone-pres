SPIRITUAL PRACTICE for the week of September 29 to October 18: Retreat!

The desert fathers of the early Christian faith, chose a Christian hermitage lifestyle. They withdrew themselves from the world into the desert places to meditate, pray, read scriptures, and live quietly - to be in the world but not of the world. Here are two sites from which you can learn more about the desert fathers:

Retreat into the wilderness to spend time in prayer and with God, asking questions, seeking God's leading in one's life, centering one's mind and soul upon Christ, living in silence to listen for God's Spirit to speak, and engaging one's mind upon a spiritual practice are long-sought after disciplines in the Christian life.  Retreat is not an avoidance of people. It is much more a reckoning of one's spirit, mind, body, and strength with the a disciplined life. There are a variety of approaches to retreat: individual, group, silent, spiritually lead, pastorally lead and a variety of topics one can approach through the practice of retreat.

You will discover in participating in a retreat the center of who God has shaped you to be in this world, in this place, and in this time and discover the harmony of your life's direction with God's will.  Not only can retreat be weeks or even days, retreat can be found in the daily practice of withdrawing to your room for a set period of time at a set time each day.  Within that context one can retreat through the Office of Prayer through the course of the day. Resources for morning prayer, midday prayers, and evening prayers are available through many sites, my personal favorites are *The Book of Common Worship; A Guide to Prayer;* and, *Daily Prayer, Supplemental Liturgical Resource*. 

Jesus regularly practiced retreat as the scriptures tell us:

* Matthew 14:13
* Mark 3:7
* Luke 5:16
* Luke 9:10
* John 6:15
* John 11:54

Be encouraged this week in your faith journey to create opportunity to withdraw to a private place to spend time with God. When you hear of an opportunity to participate in a planned retreat through Olympia Presbytery, be encouraged to participate. If you are interested in attending a retreat and would like Pastor Jen to organize one - be sure to hit her up! She would LOVE to provide the leadership and guidance for a retreat with you and your group. 

Serving Christ together in Faith, Hope, and Love and the greatest of these is LOVE ~ Pastor Jen
