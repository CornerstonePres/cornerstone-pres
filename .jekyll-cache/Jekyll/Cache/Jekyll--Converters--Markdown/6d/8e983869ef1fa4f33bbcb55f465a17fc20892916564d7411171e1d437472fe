I"<p>This week’s SPIRITUAL PRACTICE: <em>Creative Time with God</em></p>

<p>Jeremiah 18:1-6</p>

<p>This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD: “Go down to the potter’s house, and there I will give you my message.” So I went down to the potter’s house, and I saw him working at the wheel. But the pot he was shaping from the clay was marred in his hands; so the potter formed it into another pot, shaping it as seemed best to him.</p>

<p>Then the word of the LORD came to me. He said, “Can I not do with you, Israel, as this potter does?” declares the LORD. “Like clay in the hand of the potter, so are you in my hand, Israel.”</p>

<p>Just as God instructed Jeremiah to discover God’s message for the people through artistic metaphors (the clay that was marred, destroyed, and recrafted) our spiritual time with God can be built up through creative directions. Perhaps you enjoy gardening, turning clay, painting, making music, writing, taking photographs, buildling houses or spaces within houses, coloring, drawing, or decorating.  In your personal creative expressions this week, make time to intentionally notice what your spirit hears, sees, and creates. Seek the meaning on that spiritual level for surely God is present. Seek me and you will find me (Matthew 7:7)</p>
