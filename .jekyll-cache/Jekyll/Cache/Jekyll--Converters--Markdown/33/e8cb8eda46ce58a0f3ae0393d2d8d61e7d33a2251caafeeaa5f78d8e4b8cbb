I"Á<p><strong>COVID-19 announcement:</strong> during this time we will not be holding children‚Äôs Sunday School at the church.</p>

<p>This week‚Äôs lesson is from ‚ÄúGrowing In God‚Äôs Love‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>Explore Bible stories about bread and feeding.</strong><br />
Read Exodus 16:2‚Äì5, 11‚Äì15, 31, the story of the Israelites in the wilderness, the time where God sent them manna to eat. Or read ‚ÄúJust Enough,‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>Wonder together</strong> what it means to have enough‚Äîenough of your needs provided so that others may have theirs provided too.</p>

<p><strong>Read John 6:1‚Äì15</strong>, the story of a boy sharing his lunch and Jesus feeding a large crowd.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Jesus‚Äô statement about being the bread of life comes after the feeding of the five thousand. Read John 6:25‚Äì38 for a fuller context.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Tell about times when others have shared what they have with you when you needed it. Consider what it might mean if Jesus said, ‚ÄúI am ______ (what was needed and shared).‚Äù</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Be fed spiritually.<br />
    Sometimes we think about being fed spiritually</li>
    </ul>

    <p>‚Äîthat we need spiritual food just as the body</p>

    <p>needs bread or physical food.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>‚Ä¢ In what ways are you fed spiritually‚Äî</p>

<p><strong>Matthew 19:14</strong> Jesus said, ‚ÄúLet the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.‚Äù</p>

<p>Our Children‚Äôs Sunday School is a welcoming environment where kids can learn about how God loves them, and how to have a personal relationship with Him. Visual aids, craft activities, storytelling, play, and Bible reading are ways we engage with children. We separate kids into two classes: preschool for ages 1 to 5, or elementary for ages 6 to 12.</p>

<p><strong>Preschool class for ages 1-5:</strong><br />
We use a room packed with toys and books. We begin with supervised play, followed by storytelling, music, and books to teach simple biblical truths. We end with a simple craft activity, or more playtime.</p>

<p><strong>Elementary class for ages 6-12:</strong><br />
We begin with sharing what we are thankful for and praying for specific needs mentioned by the kids, which mirrors the group prayer time in the adult service. We then tell a Bible story using helpful visual aids, and kids have the opportunity to read from the Bible. Finally, we consolidate what we‚Äôve learned through creative activities such as arts, crafts, quizzes, and puzzles.</p>
