<p>The mission of this <code class="highlighter-rouge">small</code> group is to deepen our faith together in an informal, family-style setting. We begin by having lunch, with vegan and vegetarian options available. We then read passages from a Christian book about an aspect of faith or a book in the Bible. We change our theme or book every couple of months. Topic discussions are facilitated by a small group leader. Everyone is encouraged to share their thoughts, experiences, and prayers related to the topic. If you want somewhere to discuss your faith with others, join us!</p>
