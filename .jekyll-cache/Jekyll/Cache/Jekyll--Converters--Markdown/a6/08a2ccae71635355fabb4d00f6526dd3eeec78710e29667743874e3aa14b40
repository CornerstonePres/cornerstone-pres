I"#<p><strong>WORSHIP WITH US :</strong> during the time of COVID-19  WORSHIP will begin at 10 a.m. using ZOOM. We will add the Youtube Live Stream of Pastor Jen’s scripture and sermon at 10:35 a.m. A link to the current livestream will be provided the morning of the live stream.</p>

<p><strong>1 Corinthians 2:13</strong> And we impart this in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual truths to those who are spiritual.</p>

<p>When you walk into Cornerstone, you will be warmly welcomed.</p>

<p>We gather at 10 AM, and start by worshiping, and praising God through Christian praise music and traditional hymns, led by the Worship Team.   <a href="?">Join the Worship Team</a></p>

<p>A key part of our service are the Prayers of the People. Together, we lift up our praises, thanksgivings, sins, and needs before God, assured of God’s forgiveness and in anticipation of God’s answers to our prayers. Anyone in attendance can request a prayer from the larger congregation; we believe that this is essential for encouraging one another in our walk of faith.</p>

<p>Pastor Jen teaches with depth and creativity. She leads us to study and meditate on a Bible passage from the liturgical calendar, draw out its meaning, and guide us in its practical application for us today. Worship concludes with a benediction and a song.</p>

<p>We warmly invite you to stay afterwards so we can get to know each other, and enjoy tasty treats and coffee provided by our volunteers. <a href="?">Join a Volunteer Group</a></p>
