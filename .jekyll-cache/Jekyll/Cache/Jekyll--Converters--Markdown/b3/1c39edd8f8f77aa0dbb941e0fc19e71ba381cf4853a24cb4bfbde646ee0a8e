<p>Our pastor (Rev. Jennifer Swier) affectionately known as Pastor Jen, came to us in 2018 from Sioux Falls, South Dakota.</p>

<p>Pastor Jen is a Teaching Elder, ordained in July 2002. She has a Master of Divinity and graduated as Valedictorian. She has been a solo pastor in several small churches, and has also served as Associate Pastor for Youth and Young Adults.</p>

<p>Pastor Jen has a close relationship with God, a deep love of scripture, and a talent for teaching it. She sees herself as ministering alongside us with a servant style of leadership, and being a supportive cheerleader of Godâ€™s people.</p>

<p>Her love for people is shown in her sense of humor and how easy she is to talk to. She has a big heart for young families. Pastor Jen has over 30 years experience working with teens in various settings; so, she knows how to treat others with compassion, love, and patience.</p>

<p>Jen loves the outdoors, and has hobbies like backpacking and sailing! She has also enjoyed several adventures with fun experiences with multi-generational mission trips with both seniors and youth.</p>

<p>All of us at Cornerstone welcome you to worship with us and meet Pastor Jen. Come and see for yourself why we are so excited to have her here!</p>
