<p>Volunteering to help kids succeed in school is a ton of fun, so contact us if you‚Äôd like to help! We mainly need two kinds of volunteers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>People to help the kids. This could be homework and studying help, or general help like keeping track of the points for the kids‚Äô rewards, running games, washing dishes, or bringing materials.</li>
  <li>Cooks that can prepare dinner, or people that can bring or prepare dessert. We have a kitchen facility here at the church that you can use for your own convenience.</li>
</ul>
