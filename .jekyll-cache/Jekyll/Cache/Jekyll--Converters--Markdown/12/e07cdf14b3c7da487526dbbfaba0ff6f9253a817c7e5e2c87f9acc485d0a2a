I"˘<p>SPIRITUAL PRACTICE for the week of May 5-11: <em>Taking Time to Notice</em></p>

<p>Two weeks ago was the anniversary of my eldest sibling‚Äôs death. Her favorite symbolic creation was the dragonfly. The dragonfly reminded her of transformation - God‚Äôs transforming power that makes all things new. As with many people whose loved one has passed, we often notice their favorite bird or their favorite creation and are reminded of their presence in our life.</p>

<p>I was grieving the morning of the anniversary when my daughter called. She noticed my sadness and said, ‚ÄúI hope you see a dragonfly today.‚Äù</p>

<p>The afternoon was bright and sunny despite my grief. I decided to take a walk that afternoon and get a dose of sun and scenery.  Midway through the walk I was looking down at my dog sniffing the smells all around him - noticing what other creatures had left their scent, when I noticed a shadow on the pavement. The shadow was of a giant dragonfly. As my gaze wandered up, I spotted it directly in front of me. It hovered there for a few moments before zipping away in search of what it would notice in its existence.</p>

<p>Our time here is brief my friends.</p>

<p>Take Time to Notice each day this week the wonders God has in store for you.</p>
