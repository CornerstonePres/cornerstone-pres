I"v<p><strong>THIS GROUP IS NOT MEETING AT THIS TIME. VISIT HERE FREQUESNTLY AS THEY WILL START UP AGAIN SOON.</strong></p>

<p><strong>WEDNESDAYS at 6:30 p.m.</strong> at Cornerstone Presbyterian Church in a COVID-safe environment.</p>

<p>This small group of 18-30somethings meets weekly to connect, build faith relationships, reflect on a theme found in scriptures, serve together in the community, and enjoy fellowship activities.</p>

<p><strong>Peter wrote to the church in his first letter (1 Peter 2:4-10):</strong></p>

<p>“As you come to him, who is the Living Stone [Jesus] - rejected by humans but chosen by God and precious to God - you also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. For in Scripture it states:</p>

<p>“See, I lay a stone in Zion, a chosen and precious cornerstone, and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame.”</p>

<p>Now to you who believe, this stone is precious. But those who do not believe,</p>

<p>“The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone,”</p>

<p>and, “A stone that causes people to stumble and a rock that makes them fall.”</p>

<p>They stumble because they disobey the message - which is also what they were destined for.</p>

<p>But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light. Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.”</p>
