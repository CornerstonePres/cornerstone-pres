I"Ó<p>If you would like to give an offering to support Cornerstone Presbyterian Church and its various ministries, you can do so in person with cash or check at one of our wooden <strong>Tithe &amp; Offering</strong> boxes, located on the walls of the sanctuary during a Sunday service or other event.</p>

<p>We do not currently accept online or electronic giving, due to the percentage fee that is associated with electronic transactions; we believe that 100% of your generous donation should go to where you intended.</p>

<p>In addition to keeping the lights on at Cornerstone, your donation currently financially supports:<br />
<a href="?">Millie Jenkins who is working through Youth With A Mission (YWAM) </a><br />
<a href="?">Thurston County Food Bank</a><br />
<a href="?">Union Gospel Mission</a><br />
<a href="?">Young Life of Olympia</a></p>
