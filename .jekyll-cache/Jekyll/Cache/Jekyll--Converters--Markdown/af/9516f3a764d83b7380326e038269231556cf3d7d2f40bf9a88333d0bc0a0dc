I"‚<p>The Presbytery of Olympia is a Matthew 25 Presbytery. Cornerstone Presbyterian Church is currently in process of identifying our strengths as a Matthew 25 Congregation in the Presbytery: <strong>Building a Vital Congregation, Dismantling Structural Racism, and Eradicating Systemic Poverty.</strong></p>

<p>Beginning January 1 you can follow along in a study of the Gospel of Matthew on the Spiritual Practices Tab of the website carousel and read Pastor Jenâ€™s Jottings for my reflections on the weekâ€™s reading.  We will read three verses each day.  There are 1,071 verses in Matthewâ€™s Gospel. Reading 3 verses each day will take 357 days and take us to Christmas Eveâ€™ 2021.  The daily readings will be available on the Cornerstone Presbyterian Church Facebook page.  You can also go to the Spiritual Practices tab of our website for further ideas for engaging with the scriptures.</p>
