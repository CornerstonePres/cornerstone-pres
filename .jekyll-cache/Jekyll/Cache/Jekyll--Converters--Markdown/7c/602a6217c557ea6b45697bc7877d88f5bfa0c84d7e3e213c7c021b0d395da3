<p><strong>Proverbs 16:16</strong> How much better to get wisdom than gold, to get insight rather than silver!</p>

<p>You donâ€™t need to be part of Cornerstone to come along. Any student who wants help with homework, studying, or learning something is welcome. Parents are encouraged to come see how Homework Club works and students are invited to bring their friends along!</p>

<p>Homework Club is Cornerstoneâ€™s effort to help the youth in our church and community. The evening begins with a fresh, well-rounded, home-cooked meal, including vegetarian options. Afterwards, our volunteers provide guidance by assisting students with any homework, projects, studying, or learning activities they might have. Each student has the opportunity to choose an adult to be their one-on-one mentor.</p>

<p>Students should bring their homework with them every week, and should expect an environment that best helps them; some students prefer working alone, a few of them only like a small amount of guidance, and others need a more direct one-on-one approach. Students that consistently stay focused and on-task are rewarded with prizes.</p>

<p>Homework Club is a great way for students to make friends, learn, and be rewarded for their hard work. The evening includes a delicious dessert, volunteer speakers, and occasional game night. We conclude the night with a time of prayer for the needs of each student.</p>

<p>Volunteering to help kids succeed in school is a ton of fun! We mainly need two kinds of volunteers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mentors - who are people who help the kids with their goals and homework. This could be homework and studying help, or general help like keeping track of the points for the kidsâ€™ rewards, washing dishes, or bringing materials.</li>
  <li>Cooks that can prepare a main course or prepare dessert. We have a kitchen facility at the church that can be used for your convenience.</li>
</ul>

<p>Contact us if youâ€™d like to help out, or enroll your child!</p>
