<p>Our youth enjoy attending Young Life and Pastor Jen is a volunteer with Young Life of Greater Olympia (YLGO) serving students at Capital High School. Young Life meets on Pod A every second and fourth Monday at 7 p.m. Young Life is an amazing time of connecting with your friends, making new friends, playing games, having food, and one of the adult leaders shares a brief message.</p>

<p>Campaigners is where students explore the Bible and their faith understanding. Campaigner groups meet at various times during the week. Pastor Jen can help you get connected with a Campaigners group.</p>

<p>Camp Malibu in Canada is where Young Life students go to hang with their friends, be engaged in activities, explore, grow, and share all the questions and ideas they have about their faith for one week every summer. The dates for 2020 are July 27-August 2.</p>
