I"­<p>We do not currently accept online or electronic giving, due to the percentage fee that is associated with electronic transactions; we believe that 100% of your generous donation should go to where you intend.  During the time of COVID-19, we encourage you to mail in your donations using checks to the church address.</p>

<p>If you would like to give an offering to support Cornerstone Presbyterian Church and its various ministries, you can do so in person with cash or check at one of our wooden <strong>Tithe &amp; Offering</strong> boxes, located on the walls of the sanctuary during a Sunday service or other event.</p>
