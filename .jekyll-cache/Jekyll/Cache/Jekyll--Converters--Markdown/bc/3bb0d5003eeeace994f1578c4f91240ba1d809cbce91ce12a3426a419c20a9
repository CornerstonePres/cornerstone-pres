<p>We are comfortable about praying for others and have assurance that God answers prayer, trusting in the presence and power of God for the apparently impossible.</p>

<p>We have a reverence for God and God’s will for my life.</p>

<p>We strive to increase in the knowledge of God and learn the meaning of key words in scripture.</p>
