I"[<p>This week’s SPIRITUAL PRACTICE: Lectio Divina</p>

<p>You will need your Bible and something to write with and upon.</p>

<p>You may choose to start your day with this practice and find that it “walks with you” through the day; or, in the evening as you come to close of the day, the practice may offer you solace, peace of mind, and calming of anxieties.</p>

<p>Lectio Divina is the practice of prayerfully reading scripture. The scriptures are God’s Word spoken to you in the present moment - alive, the Living Word.</p>

<p>Begin with a <strong>Prayer of Preparation</strong>: “Loving God, you have so made us that we cannot live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from your mouth. Give us a hunger for your Word, and in that food satisfy our daily need; through Jesus the Christ. Amen” [<em>Book of Common Worship</em>, p. 20]. Repeat this prayer until you feel ready to be open to what God’s Living Word is speaking today.</p>

<p>Choose a Bible passage (<em>for example</em>): The Gospel of John chapter 17, verses 20 through 26 [John 17:20-26]</p>

<p>During your second reading of John 17:20-26 write down the verse you notice most.</p>

<p>In your third reading of John 17:20-26 write down all words that speak to your mind, heart, and spirit.</p>

<p>Prayerfully ask the Holy Spirit to speak to you from this Living Word: *notice what your soul hears with its spiritual ears; *what your heart sees with your spiritual eyes. Write this down if you so choose or hold the reflection in your heart. Perhaps God’s Word speaks words of invitation to notice the delight of “BEING” and sometimes God’s word prompts us to action “DOING”.</p>

<p>Close your practice with <strong>Prayer and Blessing</strong>: “O Lord our God, you are always more ready to bestow your good gifts upon us than we are to seek them. You are more willing to give than we desire or deserve. Help us so to seek that we may truly find, so to ask that we may joyfully receive, so to knock that the door of mercy may be opened for us; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen” [<em>Book of Common Worship</em>, p. 361]</p>
