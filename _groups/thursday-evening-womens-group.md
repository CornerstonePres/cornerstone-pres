**This Small Group meets Thursdays at 6:45 p.m.** 

This Thursday, July 29th, the group will be discussing Ch. 5 in the book A Long Obedience in the Same Direction by Eugene Peterson and Psalm 123. 

Food for thought: 

* Service begins with an upward look to God.
* What does God's mercy in your life look like?
* A servant is not greater than his master.

  * What inspires you to serve?
