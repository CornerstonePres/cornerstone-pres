**This Small Group meets Thursdays at 7 p.m.** 

This Thursday, July 22nd, the group will be discussing Ch. in the book A Long Obedience in the Same Direction by Eugene Peterson and Psalm 122. 

Some of the questions we will be discussing are:

* What in worship brings you to the core or framework of God?
* What are your emotions and thoughts that come with worship.
* New thoughts on judgment?
