title: Living Stones Young Adult
---
**WEDNESDAYS at 6:30 p.m.** at Cornerstone Presbyterian Church in a COVID-safe environment.

This small group of 18-30somethings meets weekly to connect, build faith relationships, reflect on a theme found in scriptures, serve together in the community, and enjoy fellowship activities.

**Peter wrote to the church in his first letter (1 Peter 2:4-10):**

"As you come to him, who is the Living Stone \[Jesus] - rejected by humans but chosen by God and precious to God - you also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. For in Scripture it states:

"See, I lay a stone in Zion, a chosen and precious cornerstone, and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame." 

Now to you who believe, this stone is precious. But those who do not believe, 

"The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone,"

and,

\
"A stone that causes people to stumble and a rock that makes them fall."

They stumble because they disobey the message - which is also what they were destined for.

But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light. Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy."
