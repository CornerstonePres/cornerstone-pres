This weekly small group dives deep into the study of scripture and faith-related topics. We learn about the cultural context, the original language, and the historical background of the text being studied; we apply what we learn in these texts to our real lives. Subjects and books for study are chosen by the group and by the pastor. Those with a thirst for knowledge and context should join us!
