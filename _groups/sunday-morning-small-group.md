During the COVID-19 social distancing, this group is meeting via ZOOM.  The link to "join the meeting" will be included here each week.



This weekly small group dives deep into the study of scripture and faith-related topics. We learn about the cultural context, the original language, and the historical background of the text being studied; we apply what we learn in these texts to our real lives. Subjects and books for study are chosen by the group and by the pastor. Those with a thirst for knowledge and context should join us!
