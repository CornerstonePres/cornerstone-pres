Our Children’s Sunday School is a welcoming environment where kids can learn about how God loves them, and how to have a personal relationship with Him. Visual aids, craft activities, storytelling, play, and Bible reading are ways we engage with children. We separate kids into two classes: preschool for ages 1 to 5, or elementary for ages 6 to 12. Contact us if you have any questions.\

**Preschool class for ages 1-5:**\
We use a room packed with toys and books. We begin with supervised play, followed by storytelling, music, and books to teach simple biblical truths. We end with a simple craft activity, or more playtime.

**Elementary class for ages 6-12:**\
We begin with sharing what we are thankful for and praying for specific needs mentioned by the kids, which mirrors the group prayer time in the adult service. We then tell a Bible story using helpful visual aids, and kids have the opportunity to read from the Bible. Finally, we consolidate what we've learned through creative activities such as arts, crafts, quizzes, and puzzles.

**Matthew 19:14** Jesus said, “Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.”
