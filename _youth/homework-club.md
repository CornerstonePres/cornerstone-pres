**Proverbs 16:16** How much better to get wisdom than gold, to get insight rather than silver!

You don’t need to be part of Cornerstone to come along. Any student who needs help with homework, studying, or learning something is welcome. Students should tell their friends and bring them along! Parents are encouraged to come along to see how Homework Club works.

Homework Club is Cornerstone’s effort to help the youth at our church, and also in our general community. First, we provide a fresh, well-rounded, home-cooked meal, including vegetarian options. Afterwards, our volunteers provide guidance by assisting students with any homework, studying, or learning they might have.

Students should bring their homework with them every week, and should expect an environment that best helps them; some students prefer working alone, a few of them only like a small amount of guidance, and others need a more direct one-on-one approach. Students that consistently stay focused and on-task are rewarded with prizes.

Between the delicious food and dessert, occasional games and movie nights, and volunteer speakers, Homework Club is a great way for students to make friends, learn, and be rewarded for their hard work.

Volunteering is a ton of fun! We mainly need two kinds of volunteers:

* People to help the kids. This could be homework and studying help, or general help like keeping track of the points for the kids' rewards, running games, washing dishes, or bringing materials.
* Cooks that can prepare dinner, or people that can bring or prepare dessert. We have a kitchen facility here at the church that you can use for your own convenience.
