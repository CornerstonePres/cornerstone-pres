The vision of our Music & Worship Team is to create an environment that inspires all to worship through spirit filled song, scripture readings, prayer, and meditation.  They are a talented group of individuals who serve with a joyful heart and strive to bring meaningful worship to Cornerstone. In our planning meetings, we make an effort to reach out to all age groups for participation in worship and prepare relevant themes and songs so that Sunday mornings are truly an uplifting and cohesive experience.

We sing Christian praise music and traditional hymns with a contemporary style that focuses on guitars and drums. For all of us on the team, it is a blessing to be able to worship through the expression of music. Join us if you have a voice to lend or an instrument to play!
