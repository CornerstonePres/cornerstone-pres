The function of the Buildings & Grounds Committee is the care and maintenance of the Cornerstone campus and buildings. Our vision is to always follow proper procedures that ensure the responsible stewardship of the beautiful grounds and facility that God has provided us.

Members of Buildings & Grounds Committee perform landscaping tasks and maintenance of the church buildings and the rental property we lease out to tenants. Other areas of responsibility include tasks that are necessary to keep the buildings in compliance with local and state regulations. Buildings & Grounds Committee meetings are convened on an as-needed basis.

We have various ongoing work projects throughout the year. We meet every Saturday during the Spring and Summer months at 9 AM for “Lovin’ The Lawn," but this can change in the Fall and Winter depending on the weather. However, every fall we have a major half day for cleanup. The Rock Church, who uses our facility for their weekly worship, assists us in this endeavor. 

This is all volunteer work, so we gladly welcome anyone who would like to lend a helping hand.
