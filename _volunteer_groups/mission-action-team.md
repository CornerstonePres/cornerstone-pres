Cornerstone Presbyterian Church collaborates with local non-profit organizations to put our faith into action.  The Mission Action Team makes recommendations to Session concerning local missions.   Cornerstone provides financial support to various organizations including Olympia Union Gospel Mission, Thurston County Food Bank, Young Life of Olympia, and Hagar's Community Church at the Washington Corrections Center for Women in Gig Harbor.  Other Mission Action Team activities have included a youth Homework Club, and providing encouragement through cards and treats to employees of Providence St. Peter Hospital during the Covid pandemic.
