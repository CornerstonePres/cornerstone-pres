  Our pastor (Rev. Jennifer Swier) affectionately known as Pastor Jen, came to
  us in 2018 from Sioux Falls, South Dakota.


  Pastor Jen is a Teaching Elder, ordained in July 2002. She has a Master of
  Divinity and graduated as Valedictorian. She has been a solo pastor in several
  small churches, and has also served as Associate Pastor for Youth and Young
  Adults.


  Pastor Jen has a close relationship with God, a deep love of scripture, and a
  talent for teaching it. She sees herself as ministering alongside us with a
  servant style of leadership, and being a supportive cheerleader of God's
  people.


  Her love for people is shown in her sense of humor and how easy she is to talk
  to. She has a big heart for young families. Pastor Jen has over 30 years
  experience working with teens in various settings; so, she knows how to treat
  others with compassion, love, and patience.


  Jen loves the outdoors, and has hobbies like backpacking and sailing! She has
  also enjoyed several adventures with fun experiences with multi-generational
  mission trips with both seniors and youth.


  All of us at Cornerstone welcome you to worship with us and meet Pastor Jen.
  Come and see for yourself why we are so excited to have her here!
