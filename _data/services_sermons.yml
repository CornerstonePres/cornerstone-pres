    Our service lasts for roughly an hour from start to finish, including
    everything from music, to prayer time, to the actual sermon.


    We begin with songs of praise, which include a mix of contemporary worship
    songs and traditional hymns. Between songs, we greet each other.


    Before the sermon begins, we share a few minutes of prayer time. Together,
    we lift up our praise, thanksgiving, sins, and needs before God, assured of
    His forgiveness and in anticipation of His answers to our prayers. Anyone in
    attendance can request a prayer from the larger congregation; we believe
    that this is essential for encouraging one another in our walk of faith.


    Finally, Pastor Jennifer Swier preaches a sermon, which lasts roughly half
    an hour. Sermons focus on exegesis, which is an objective and unbiased way
    to study scripture, and involves practices like delving into the authorâ€™s
    original context to draw out the true meaning of a passage. Jennifer teaches
    with creativity, and occasionally uses physical objects as elements of her
    sermon. No two sermons are the same!


    **1 Corinthians 2:13** And we impart this in words not taught by human
    wisdom but taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual truths to those who
    are spiritual.
