    **Love God,**\

    **Love Others,**\

    **Serve the World.**


    Cornerstone Presbyterian Church is a Christ-centered community, helping people of all ages love God, love others and serve the world. As a Christ-centered community, we strive to treat every person we encounter in our daily lives as Jesus sees them, a child of God. Our relationships are based on the love of Christ, who chose to love us while we were still sinners.


    We live out our vision by active involvement both in our church and in our community. Our volunteers fund, prepare and serve dinner once a month at Union Gospel Mission; our Deacons serve those with spiritual, physical and financial needs. Other church members informally reach out to people without homes and those experiencing mental illness. We make a conscious effort to use our gifts and talents both individually and together to do things that glorify Jesus and draw people to Him.\

    We uphold the Essential Tenets of the faith.


    With all Christians around the world we believe and adopt:


    * The Triune God

    * The Incarnation


    As Reformed Christians we believe and adopt:


    * God’s Sovereignty

    * God’s Unconditional Election

    * God’s calling us to Stewardship

    * Our Sinfulness

    * Our calling to seek justice


    As Presbyterian Christians we are said to be “Reformed and always Reforming.”


    Order of importance:


    1. God – Father, Son, and Holy Spirit

    2. Scripture

    3. Creeds and Confessions

    4. Form of Government

    5. Experience


    We are comfortable about praying for others and have assurance that God answers prayer, trusting in the presence and power of God for the apparently impossible.


    We are concerned that our interpersonal relationships be peaceable, reasonable, and without partiality or hypocrisy, showing a genuine graciousness towards and appreciation of each guest.


    We have a reverence for God and God’s will for my life.


    We strive to increase in the knowledge of God and learn the meaning of key words in scripture.


    Cornerstone Presbyterian Church is part of the PC(USA), short for Presbyterian Church USA. We adhere to the Constitution of the PC(USA) which consists of the Book of Confessions and the Book of Order.\
