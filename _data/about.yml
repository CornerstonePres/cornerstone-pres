    The denomination of Cornerstone Presbyterian Church is the PC(USA), short
    for the Presbyterian Church of the United States of America. We promise to
    adhere to the PC(USA) Constitution, which consists of the Book of
    Confessions and the Book of Order


    [Learn more about the PC(USA)](https://www.pcusa.org/)


    We uphold the Essential Tenets.




    With all Christians around the world we believe and adopt:


    * The Triune God

    * The Incarnation




    As Reformed Christians we believe and adopt:


    * God’s Sovereignty

    * God’s Unconditional Election

    * God’s calling us to Stewardship

    * Our Sinfulness

    * Our calling to seek justice




    As Presbyterian Christians we are said to be “Reformed and always
    Reforming.”




    Order of importance:


    1. God – Father, Son, and Holy Spirit

    2. Scripture

    3. Creeds and Confessions

    4. Form of Government

    5. Experience




    We are comfortable about praying for others and have assurance that God
    answers prayer, trusting in the presence and power of God for the apparently
    impossible.




    We are concerned that our interpersonal relationships be peaceable,
    reasonable, and without partiality or hypocrisy, showing a genuine
    graciousness towards and appreciation of each guest.




    We have a reverence for God and God’s will for my life.




    We strive to increase in the knowledge of God and learn the meaning of key
    words in scripture.
