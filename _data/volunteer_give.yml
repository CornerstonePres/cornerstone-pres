    We do not currently accept online or electronic giving, due to the
    percentage fee that is associated with electronic transactions; we believe
    that 100% of your generous donation should go to where you intend.  During
    the time of COVID-19, we encourage you to mail in your donations using
    checks to the church address.


    If you would like to give an offering to support Cornerstone Presbyterian Church and its various ministries, you can do so in person with cash or check at one of our wooden **Tithe & Offering** boxes, located on the walls of the sanctuary during a Sunday service or other event.


    Want to offer your time instead of your money?\

    Thank you for supporting Cornerstone Presbyterian Church by offering your time and talents! We have a whole lot of groups to volunteer for, and you can see those directly below. However, if you're sure you want to help, but aren't sure how, or just want to fill an area of need, contact us! Providing us with a list of skills that you can offer will help us slot you into a volunteer group that makes sense for you.
