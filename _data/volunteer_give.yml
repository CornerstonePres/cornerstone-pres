    If you would like to give an offering to support Cornerstone Presbyterian
    Church and its various ministries, you can do so in person with cash or
    check at one of our wooden **Tithe & Offering** boxes, located on the walls
    of the sanctuary during a Sunday service or other event.


    We do not currently accept online or electronic giving, due to the
    percentage fee that is associated with electronic transactions; we believe
    that 100% of your generous donation should go to where you intended.


    Want to offer your time instead of your money?\
