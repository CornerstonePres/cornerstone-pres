    description: "Mission Action Team has a Guiding Statement:  •\tAct as
      responsible stewards of Cornerstone Presbyterian Church’s gifts and tithes
      by identifying, partnering and contributing to the greater Olympia,
      regional and global organizations, and  •\tFocus outward, provide
      guidance, and identify opportunities for the congregation to use time and
      skills to directly participate in mission activities.   Homework Club
      Homework Club started off the year as usual, having a meal, helping the
      youth with their homework and helping the Seniors with plans for their
      future.  Then COVID hit and we were unable to meet in person. We regrouped
      in March and zoomed with the youth on Wednesday nights; it was not very
      academically effective, but we wanted to keep the relationships going.  At
      this point we have been helping the seniors going to college, get all
      their necessary things done, FAFSA, applications to colleges and
      encouraging virtual visits to the schools their interested. We appreciated
      the leadership of adults who helped with driving instruction for some of
      the youth.   At this point we are staying in touch with them and seeing
      how we can help them.  They are all doing well. Participants in Homework
      Club this year: Elijah, Samara, Dom, Vito, Harland, Jaylen, Hayder, Jade,
      Carlos"
