<p><strong>5:30pm to 8:00pm</strong> every Wednesday, while school is in session.</p>

<p>You don’t need to be part of Cornerstone to come along. Any student who needs help with homework, studying, or learning something is welcome. Students should tell their friends and bring them along! Parents are encouraged to come along to see how Homework Club works. <a href="index.html">Contact Us</a> if you have any questions.</p>

<p>Homework Club is Cornerstone’s effort to help the youth at our church, and also in our general community. First, we provide a fresh, well-rounded, home-cooked meal, including vegetarian options. Afterwards, our volunteers provide guidance by assisting students with any homework, studying, or learning they might have.</p>

<p>Students should bring their homework with them every week, and should expect an environment that best helps them; some students prefer working alone, a few of them only like a small amount of guidance, and others need a more direct one-on-one approach. Students that consistently stay focused and on-task are rewarded with prizes.</p>

<p>Between the delicious food (and dessert!), occasional game and movie nights, and volunteer speakers, Homework Club is a great way for students to make friends, learn, and be rewarded for their hard work.</p>
