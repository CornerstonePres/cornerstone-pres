    <p>REFLECTIONS ON THE READING OF THE GOSPEL OF MATTHEW: Chapter 1:1-3</p>

<p>I like learning about scripture from an historical context. I have found that the most authentic understanding of a writing is to understand it (as much as possible) through the lens of the writer, the circumstances they were facing in the time period from which they wrote, and the people to whom they were writing for that is where the heart, purpose, hope for outcome, and purest intent finds its seed for propagation (telling forth the truth of the gospel). Scholars who study the scriptures are the most reliable source of this type of information.</p>

<p>It is my understanding that Matthew’s Gospel was written to the Hebrew people to encourage them to place their faith in God that Jesus of Nazareth was and is God’s promised Messiah.  Matthew wrote in a particular style for this very specific purpose. His gospel is written in a mirror from of the Pentateuch (the first 5 books of the Old Testament in the Christian Bible): Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. Matthew’s gospel is written in 5 parts as well.</p>

<p>For more information I encourage you to read a commentary such as: <em>The Interpreter’s Bible, Interpretation Commentary, Matthew Henry’s Commentary, John Calvin’s Commentary</em>. There is a long list of commentaries available. If you are a member of Cornerstone and would like more information, Pastor Jen is willing to lend you a commentary. Please speak with her directly.</p>

<p>My personal reflections are updated every Tuesday with reflections on the previous week’s readings. All of the reflections are on this page beginning with the most recent.</p>

<p><strong>January 5, 2021</strong></p>

<p>My dad passed away the night before Thanksgiving in 2020. My brother pointed out to us on Thanksgiving when we went to the funeral home that leaving a legacy was important to my dad.  Growing up we learned a great deal about my mother’s family; however, my dad was much quieter about his side of the family.  I can remember searching him out in the furnace room, where he would sit at his work bench reloading his ammunition cartridges for the coming year’s hunting season - it was a money saver.  There in the dimly lit, quiet, cozy, rustic space in the corner of the basement, I would inquire about my dad’s family. I continued to ask him bits and pieces over the years and even on the last night that we spoke when he was still lucid, he said, “I have something important to tell you about my family.”  Those moments of listening to my dad tell his life’s story will remain his legacy to me and some of my fondest memories with my dad.</p>

<p>The first time I ever started to read the Gospels from start to finish on my own, I was 15.  I began to read it because my dad’s mom had passed away and my dad had returned from Oregon with his mom’s Bible, the one he had given to her the Christmas of 1957 when he entered the United States Air Force.  Reading those words in King James fashion, “Abraham begat Isaac, Isaac begat Jacob, Jacob begat…” it was heavy for a young mind to decipher the importance and value.</p>

<p>It’s about more than lineage.  It’s like remembering the family stories. Most of us have them - family history.  Those stories that get passed along generation after generation, unless there is a trauma that stops the telling of the stories (but that’s a subject for another “Pondering”)</p>

<p>The writer of the gospel crafted this opening as a mirror reflection of Genesis, as a retelling of the family story of Israel and God’s activity in the life of this family.</p>

<p>Those are what many of my favorite family stories are about as well.  When my dad was a child, he fell from a high structure (he was playing Billboard tag with his Italian friends in Portland, OR) He died and in his death, he was greeted by an angel. His angel told him, “It’s not your time yet Charlie.” And then my dad remembers the rush of his spirit reconnecting with his body. If that event had not taken place, I would not be here today in the form with which I greet you.</p>

<p>And so we do not take lightly Matthew’s telling Jesus’ family story for God was at work through them for generations! 14 generations between Abraham and David, 14 generations from David to the exile to Babylon, and 14 generations from the exile to the Messiah as Matthew tells it in verse 17 of the opening chapter. And Jesus’ lineage had some colorful characters according to scripture.</p>

<p>Jesus’ great grandmother was the prostitute, Rahab. Another of his grandmothers was Bathsheba, whose husband, Uriah, King David had murdered so that she could become his wife. Ruth who was not a Hebrew but was welcomed in as an alien from a foreign land and she shared in the inherited promise of God through Israel. Jacob who tricked and stole his brother, Esau’s, inheritance and blessing. Judah who attempted to talk his brothers out of murdering their brother, Joseph, out of jealousy and covetousness; and, instead, encouraged his brothers to sell Joseph into slavery. Yes, a very colorful past in Jesus’ lineage. Even so, Jesus’ family was of the royal house of David through whom God made a covenant with his people.</p>

<p>And so, I do not take lightly the listing of Jesus’ family. I pray you will also not take it lightly, or gloss over it too quickly.  In what family events can you witness the activity of God in your lives that might also be an encouragement to the faith journey of another soul who walks a parallel path?</p>

<p>Love in Christ, Pastor Jen</p>
