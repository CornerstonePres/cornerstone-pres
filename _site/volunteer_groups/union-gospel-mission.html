<p>At Cornerstone, we feel obligated to do what we can to help the homeless in the community of Olympia. As such, we volunteer at the Union Gospel Mission once a month in an event known as “Taco Monday.” Together, we feed those in need with 30 pounds of ground beef, 5 pounds of rice, 6 gallons beans, 5 pounds of cheese, 10 pounds of onions, a gallon of salsa, way too much lettuce, and roughly 300 taco shells! As you can imagine, this is quite an undertaking, and requires between 6 to 10 people to prepare and serve! We always need more volunteers, so come join us in this meaningful endeavor.</p>
