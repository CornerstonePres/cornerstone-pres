<p>Volunteering to help kids succeed in school is a ton of fun! We mainly need two kinds of volunteers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>People to help the kids. This could be homework and studying help, or general help like keeping track of the points for the kidsâ€™ rewards, running games, washing dishes, or bringing materials.</li>
  <li>Cooks that can prepare dinner, or people that can bring or prepare dessert. We have a kitchen facility here at the church that you can use for your own convenience.</li>
</ul>
