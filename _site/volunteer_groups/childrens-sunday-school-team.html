<p><strong>Matthew 19:14</strong> Jesus said, “Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.”</p>

<p>Our Children’s Sunday School is a welcoming environment where kids can learn about how God loves them, and how to have a personal relationship with Him. Visual aids, craft activities, storytelling, play, and Bible reading are ways we engage with children. We separate kids into two classes: preschool for ages 1 to 5, or elementary for ages 6 to 12.</p>

<p>If you have a passion for taking care of children and helping them grow in Christ, or if you have questions about bringing your own kids along, contact us!</p>
