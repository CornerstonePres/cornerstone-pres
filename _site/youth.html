    <h1 class="title">Children's Sunday School</h1>
    <div class="content_body content">
      <p><strong>COVID-19 announcement:</strong> during this time we will not be holding children’s Sunday School at the church.</p>

<p>This week’s lesson is from “Growing In God’s Love”</p>

<p><strong>Explore Bible stories about bread and feeding.</strong><br />
Read Exodus 16:2–5, 11–15, 31, the story of the Israelites in the wilderness, the time where God sent them manna to eat. Or read “Just Enough,”</p>

<p><strong>Wonder together</strong> what it means to have enough—enough of your needs provided so that others may have theirs provided too.</p>

<p><strong>Read John 6:1–15</strong>, the story of a boy sharing his lunch and Jesus feeding a large crowd.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Jesus’ statement about being the bread of life comes after the feeding of the five thousand. Read John 6:25–38 for a fuller context.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Tell about times when others have shared what they have with you when you needed it. Consider what it might mean if Jesus said, “I am ______ (what was needed and shared).”</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Be fed spiritually.<br />
    Sometimes we think about being fed spiritually</li>
    </ul>

    <p>—that we need spiritual food just as the body</p>

    <p>needs bread or physical food.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>• In what ways are you fed spiritually—</p>

<p>reading Bible stories, praying, talking about faith questions and thoughts with others, meditating, worshiping, or some other ways?</p>

<p><strong>Connections</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Bake bread.<br />
Involve members of your family or church. Go to</li>
</ul>

<p>bit.ly/breadunderonehour for some bread recipes you can make in under one hour or use a favorite family recipe. Make enough bread to share with others.</p>

<p>Discuss:<br />
• What is your favorite kind of bread? • What do you like to eat with bread?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Read a book or watch a video about bread.<br />
People eat bread all over the world. Find the</li>
</ul>

<p>book Bread, Bread, Bread by Ann Morris (Harper Collins, 1993) or watch the YouTube video “Bread, Bread, Bread” (bit.ly/breadbookvideo).</p>

<p>Make a list of all the different kinds of bread you can think of. Place a mark by those you have tried.</p>

<p><strong>Service</strong></p>

<p>o Learn about gleaning.<br />
   Do an internet search for “gleaning.” Look at a</p>

<p>definition, Wikipedia, and images. g Have a conversation about gleaning.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Who are the groups in your community involved in sharing food with those in need?</li>
  <li>What is your local food bank? Is there a group involved in gleaning? Do an internet search for “gleaning near me.”</li>
  <li>
    <p>How can you get involved in helping feed others?</p>

    <p>Explore the Presbyterian Hunger Program.<br />
  Go to bit.ly/preshungerprogram. Explore the list</p>

    <p>on the right under “Learn More.” g Discuss:</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>• Are there ways you can be bread for others as a family or church?</p>

<p>Who Is Jesus?</p>

<p><strong>Every Sunday</strong>, when worship is held on-site the children are invited to join one of our adult teachers for a lesson, activity, and craft to help them connect with the Bible story being taught. <br />

<p><strong>Matthew 19:14</strong> Jesus said, “Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.”</p>

<p>Our Children’s Sunday School is a welcoming environment where kids can learn about how God loves them, and how to have a personal relationship with Him. Visual aids, craft activities, storytelling, play, and Bible reading are ways we engage with children. We separate kids into two classes: preschool for ages 1 to 5, or elementary for ages 6 to 12.</p>

<p><strong>Preschool class for ages 1-5:</strong><br />
We use a room packed with toys and books. We begin with supervised play, followed by storytelling, music, and books to teach simple biblical truths. We end with a simple craft activity, or more playtime.</p>

<p><strong>Elementary class for ages 6-12:</strong><br />
We begin with sharing what we are thankful for and praying for specific needs mentioned by the kids, which mirrors the group prayer time in the adult service. We then tell a Bible story using helpful visual aids, and kids have the opportunity to read from the Bible. Finally, we consolidate what we’ve learned through creative activities such as arts, crafts, quizzes, and puzzles.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about bringing your own kids along, or if you have a passion for taking care of children and helping them grow in Christ, contact us!</p>

<p><strong>Proverbs 16:16</strong> How much better to get wisdom than gold, to get insight rather than silver!</p>

<p>You don’t need to be part of Cornerstone to come along. Any student who wants help with homework, studying, or learning something is welcome. Parents are encouraged to come see how Homework Club works and students are invited to bring their friends along!</p>

<p>Homework Club is Cornerstone’s effort to help the youth in our church and community. The evening begins with a fresh, well-rounded, home-cooked meal, including vegetarian options. Afterwards, our volunteers provide guidance by assisting students with any homework, projects, studying, or learning activities they might have. Each student has the opportunity to choose an adult to be their one-on-one mentor.</p>

<p>Students should bring their homework with them every week, and should expect an environment that best helps them; some students prefer working alone, a few of them only like a small amount of guidance, and others need a more direct one-on-one approach. Students that consistently stay focused and on-task are rewarded with prizes.</p>

<p>Homework Club is a great way for students to make friends, learn, and be rewarded for their hard work. The evening includes a delicious dessert, volunteer speakers, and occasional game night. We conclude the night with a time of prayer for the needs of each student.</p>

<p>Volunteering to help kids succeed in school is a ton of fun! We mainly need two kinds of volunteers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mentors - who are people who help the kids with their goals and homework. This could be homework and studying help, or general help like keeping track of the points for the kids’ rewards, washing dishes, or bringing materials.</li>
  <li>Cooks that can prepare a main course or prepare dessert. We have a kitchen facility at the church that can be used for your convenience.</li>
</ul>

<p>Contact us if you’d like to help out, or enroll your child!</p>
