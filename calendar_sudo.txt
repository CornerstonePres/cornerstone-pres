for(i of Events){
    if(i is first i){
      <h1>{{i.Month}} {{i.year}}</h1>
      <month group>
    }else if(i.Month != (i-1).Month){
      </month group>
      <h1>{{i.Month}} {{i.year}}</h1>
      <month group>
    }

    <p>{{i.date}} - {{i.description}}<p>

    if(i is last i){
      </month group>
    }
  }

  Even More Pseudo:

  Loop through events{
    if first event{
      print "month - year" of the event,
      print beginning of new event group,
      all in HTML
    }else if new month{
      print ending of "month group",
      print "month - year" of the event,
      print beginning of new event group,
      all in HTML
    }

    outside of if statement which means for every single event,
    print "date - description" of event.

    if last event{
      print ending of "month group" group in HTML
    }
  }
