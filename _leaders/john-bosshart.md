Cornerstone Presbyterian church is the fourth Presbyterian church in which I have belonged. I am currently a deacon here at Cornerstone, and I have served as an elder in 3 different congregations.Â  I am a retired civil engineer that spends most my time building homes with Habitat For Humanity in Mason County.
